  <h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p>This book is primarily an attempt to recount the many thrilling
    experiences of Edward Herbert Thompson in his lifelong quest for
    archæological treasures in the ancient and abandoned city of Chi-chen
    Itza, for centuries buried beneath the jungle of Yucatan.</p>

  <p>As a boy Mr. Thompson—or Don Eduardo, as he is affectionately known
    to the natives about the Sacred City—sat in his snug New England home
    and read of the adventures of Stephens in Yucatan, descriptions of the
    old Maya civilization, and the legends concerning the Sacred Well at
    Chi-chen Itza. Then and there he determined that his life-work should
    be the uncovering of the age-old secrets of the ancient city.</p>

  <p>When still a mere youth he was appointed by the President of the United
    States as the first American Consul to Yucatan, the appointment having
    been urged by the American Antiquarian Society and the Peabody Museum
    of Harvard University, both of which were anxious to have a trained
    investigator on the peninsula.</p>

  <p>Enthusiastically Mr. Thompson undertook his double mission. For over
    twenty-five years he remained at his post as consul. During this long
    period, sometimes at the head of regularly organized expeditions under
    the auspices of American archæological institutions, at other times
    with only his faithful native followers, he discovered ruined cities
    until then unknown to the world and carried on exhaustive researches
    among those already discovered.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>vi</span></p>

  <p>At last Mr. Thompson resigned the consular office, in order to carry
    on the various scientific undertakings that required all his time and
    energy. Chief among these was the search for relics that for hundreds
    of years had lain buried in the mud at the bottom of the Sacred Well.</p>

  <p>Many and many a night, under the gorgeous moonlight of Yucatan or
    by some cozy fireside in the States, I have listened entranced, as
    the hours glided by, to the true tales Don Eduardo tells of his
    experiences or of the customs and the folk-lore of the country. I know
    intimately this lovable, modest, blue-eyed six-footer, this dreamer
    and adventurer, gray-haired now but still with the heart of a boy. I
    know him better, perhaps, than does any other man, and if I do not
    write down the things he has told me they will never be written, for
    Don Eduardo will not do it. Therefore I have asked and received his
    permission to write, from memory and from his notes and my own, this
    book, which he has read and corrected.</p>

  <p>It is a faithful account of the many valuable archæological finds he
    has made, but, though written as if Don Eduardo himself were speaking,
    it inevitably lacks the color and fire of his word-of-mouth narrative.
    It contains, further, such description of the Maya culture and history
    as may help the reader to understand this ancient civilization. The
    writer hopes that it may be acceptable to the avid reader of travel
    and adventure, and there is also the timid hope that it may be of some
    little educational value to the serious-minded reader, to the end that
    he may feel that he has not wasted time on a mere “yarn.”</p>

  <h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h3>

  <p>The author is indebted, for information and assistance, to many good
    friends in Yucatan, but chiefly to Señor Juan Martinez H., to the late
    Teoberto Maler, and to Mr. and Mrs. William James for their timely
    hospitality.</p>

  <p>The books and writings of the old priests, as well as current books on
    the Maya era, also have been of much aid.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">IMAGINE yourself the sole owner of a plantation within which lies a
    city more than twelve square miles in area; a city of palaces and
    temples and mausoleums; a city of untold treasures, rich in sculptures
    and paintings. Would you not feel shamefully wealthy? And does it not
    seem strange that Don Eduardo, the master of such a plantation, takes
    the fact of his ownership with apparent calmness?</p>

  <p>But, before your fancy carries you too far, let me tell you a little
    more about this remarkable city, which may dampen your ardor for
    ownership, but which only increases its value in Don Eduardo’s eyes.
    It is a dead city. Its thousands of inhabitants perished or abandoned
    it nobody knows how long ago—probably before Columbus first saw the
    shores of America. And it is in the heart of Yucatan, where Mexico,
    ending like the upflung tail of a huge fish, juts into the gulf, while
    Cuba serves as a sentinel a hundred and fifty miles to the eastward.</p>

  <p>The Treasure City, the City of the Sacred Well, with the queer-sounding
    name of the Chi-chen Itza (pronounce it Chee´chen Eet-za´), is for the
    most part overgrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> with tropical jungle. Its treasures are valuable
    only to the antiquarian.</p>

  <p>Early in our conversations about the City of the Sacred Well, Don
    Eduardo told me that because at the time of his purchase the plantation
    was well within the territory dominated by the dreaded Sublevados,
    the rebellious Maya Indians, no planter dared live in or even visit
    the region for long, and so he was able to secure the land from its
    absentee owners cheap, as plantation prices run in Yucatan.</p>

      DISTANCE FROM THE UNITED STATES.</div>
  </div>

  <p>“My life-interest has been American archæology,” he said, “and I came
    first to Yucatan, thirty years ago, to explore its ruins and relics of
    an ancient civilization. Even before that I had read of the immense
    Sacred Well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> at Chi-chen Itza—a well as wide as a small lake and deep
    enough to hold a fifteen-story building—and had made up my mind that
    I would be the man who some day made it yield up its secrets. For a
    long time I tried to persuade various wealthy Americans to finance the
    undertaking, but organizing a stock company to raise sunken galleons
    along the Spanish Main would be a simple task as compared with my
    difficulties in promoting what seemed a will-o’-the-wisp project. At
    last, however, I did succeed.”</p>

  <p>But I am ahead of my story.</p>

  <p>The trip from New York to the City of the Sacred Well requires but
    a week and may now be accomplished luxuriously, whereas my earlier
    journeys over the same route were anything but comfortable. Mr. John
    L. Stephens, who was sent to Yucatan by the United States Government
    in 1841, describes, in his interesting book “Incidents of Travel in
    Yucatan,” the difficulties of travel which he met. They might have
    daunted any spirit less courageous than his. His four volumes, although
    written nearly eighty years ago, retain their pristine freshness and
    are still authoritative. I recommend them heartily to the reader.</p>

  <p>On any Thursday the traveler destined for the City of the Sacred Well
    may board at New York a Ward Line steamer bound for Progreso, the only
    port of Yucatan. The liner stops over at Havana, and a day and a night
    after leaving that hectic city one awakes in the early dawn to the
    deep-chanted tones of a sailor who is casting the lead. “Four fathoms,”
    he cries; then, “Three fathoms,” and finally the engines are hushed and
    out goes the anchor. Through the port-hole is seen a lighthouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> and
    behind it a faint, foggy vista of low-lying sandy shore.</p>

  <p>By the time the unhurried ritual of arising has been performed and one
    appears on deck all is flooded with brilliant sunshine. The sky above
    is a cloudless cobalt blue. The day is hot, but the sea-breeze keeps it
    from being uncomfortably so. One senses, nevertheless, in some subtle
    way, that he is actually in the tropics. So shallow is the water that
    ocean-going vessels may not safely approach to within less than five
    miles of the rather uninspiring port of Progreso, marked by several
    long piers jutting into the sea and the aforementioned lighthouse.
    Passengers and goods must be taken off in lighters or in small boats.
    On approaching the shore one sees rows of pelicans sitting alongside
    the wharves—the most serious and sad-looking birds imaginable. They
    remind one of the rows of Glooms frequently portrayed by one of our
    cartoonists in the daily newspaper comic strip.</p>

  <p>There is little reason for tarrying in Progreso, even though it is
    the third most important seaport in Mexico. It is from here that the
    henequen of Yucatan is shipped, and the cultivation of this cactus-like
    plant, from whose fiber rope and twine are made, constitutes the chief
    enterprise of the province. Two railroads, one narrow-gauge, the other
    standard, cover the twenty-four miles between Progreso and the lovely
    city of Mérida, capital of Yucatan. Oddly enough, the fare is higher
    on the narrower, longer, and poorer road than on the road of standard
    gauge. The latter is modern in every respect and provided with coaches
    and locomotives imported from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> United States. The daily Peniche
    Express starts on time and arrives in the same fashion.</p>

  <p>The Grand Hotel at Mérida is the customary stopping-place for all
    foreigners and is a very good and well-operated institution. It faces
    the beautiful tree-lined Plaza Hidalgo, but is, unfortunately, located
    close to a number of churches and a cathedral whose cracked bells
    are rung mightily at various hours and particularly when one wishes
    to sleep. As a result, persons not yet hardened to this venerable
    Spanish-American custom are likely to have a broken night’s slumber.</p>

  <p>Mérida is a city of 63,000 people and is modern in many respects. It
    is hot there in the sun but cool in the shade, for there is always a
    breeze from the perpetually blowing trade-wind. The city is healthful,
    well paved, electrically lighted, and excellently served with street
    cars, and it has many handsome buildings and residences. Its population
    varies all the way from the pure Castilian, through the Mestizos, to
    the Mayas or full-blooded Indians. Almost every night a band plays in
    one of the several plazas or parks. North-American airs are favored
    and I have heard them much more badly played by musicians in our own
    land than here under the tropical moonlight, in a setting of rarely
    beautiful and fragrant flowers. During the band concert daintily clean
    Indian girls, in their voluminous embroidered dresses or <i>huipiles</i>
    and embroidered sandals, circle about. In another circle stroll their
    Indian beaux in high-heeled sandals and starched white cotton suits.
    The ladies of the upper class, dressed in the Spanish or European
    manner, are driven slowly about the plaza in their automobiles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
    Formerly carriages—the sort we call, or did call, landaus—were used,
    but the automobile has displaced these and in so doing has destroyed
    half the charm of the scene. Nevertheless it is still charming. The
    romance of it may be guaranteed to put a thrill into the cold heart of
    the loan shark from Chicago. It alone is worth the trip to Yucatan and
    it cannot be described; it has to be experienced at first hand.</p>

  <p>During the month of February there is a carnival in Mérida, ending with
    a fancy-dress ball for the four hundred socially elect. The carnival
    rivals the Mardi Gras of New Orleans and is enthusiastically celebrated
    by the whole populace. The floats and decorations are quite as costly
    and tasteful as any seen in the New Orleans celebration. One year I
    happened to be in Mérida at the time of the carnival and through the
    kindly assistance of my good friends Mr. and Mrs. James I received
    an invitation to the ball. This gorgeous affair would have compared
    creditably to any similar festivity in New York.</p>

  <p>The ball took place at the palatial home of a wealthy Yucateco. This
    house is built in the usual Yucatan fashion. In front is a large
    doorway guarded by a heavy wrought-iron grill or gate. On each side
    of the doorway are the living-quarters, consisting of a dining-room
    and what we should call a living-room. These rooms form the front of a
    quadrangular structure surrounding a patio in which are flower beds,
    fountains, and tiled walks. Around the inner wall of the quadrangle is
    a promenade wide enough for several people to walk abreast and this
    is roofed over, the tile roof being supported by pillars and arches
    of Moorish type. The wings and rear section of the house contain the
    chambers for the family and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> guests, the kitchen, and the servants’
    quarters. I imagine that this particular residence had cost not much
    less than a million dollars. The interior is finished in Italian marble
    and luxuriously furnished in the Parisian manner.</p>

  <p>And this is by no means the most palatial residence in the capital.
    The wealthy people of Yucatan spend much of their time in Europe and
    their homes show the effect. The houses have beautiful tiled floors and
    the walls are frequently frescoed or covered with excellent paintings;
    yet as a rule the rooms are somewhat bare of furniture. One building
    particularly worthy of mention is the most ancient in Mérida, erected
    in 1549 by Don Francisco Montejo, the Spanish conqueror of Yucatan. On
    its façade is a grotesque Indian-Moorish representation of two armored
    knights trampling on prostrate Indians, while below is a stone tablet
    bearing the name of Montejo and the date of building.</p>

  <p>Recently an American club was started in the city, with a membership
    of several Americans, three or four Britons, and the remainder
    Yucatecos who speak English; and some do speak it fluently. The club
    is predominantly masculine, as the only ladies who attend are those
    who have lived at some time or other in the States and have acquired
    our customs. As a rule the women of Yucatan observe the old Spanish
    custom of seclusion. Girls are not permitted to go out with young men.
    A girl’s lover may spend the evening standing before the barred window
    of his inamorata’s home, conversing with her and strumming upon his
    mandolin or guitar for her edification. If he is finally accredited as
    a suitor, he is permitted to enter the house and sit in a stiff-backed
    chair across the room from his sweetheart, but Mamma and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> Auntie and
    all the other ladies of the family are there, too, to insure decorous
    behavior.</p>

  <p>The population of Yucatan is chiefly composed of the native Indians or
    Mayas. They are simple, kindly people and capable of development, for
    they are highly intelligent. To the best of our knowledge they are the
    direct descendants of the early Mayas, who in culture and achievements
    compare favorably to the people of ancient Egypt. Some of the wealthy
    Yucatecos are descendants of the old Maya nobility and still retain the
    original names denoting noble birth. But many descendants of Maya kings
    of old are now sunk in poverty.</p>

  <p>Most of the present-day Mayas speak a language which has developed
    little from its primitive syllabic form. The Japanese, many of whom
    are found in Yucatan nowadays, learn the Maya tongue easily. In fact,
    many Japanese and Maya words are identical in sound, but as far as I
    know they have absolutely no kindred meaning. Some theorists have even
    advanced the idea that the similarity in form and construction of the
    Japanese and Maya languages indicates a common prehistoric origin. But
    there is scant proof of this, inasmuch as all primitive languages are
    syllabic in form.</p>

  <p>The Maya is short in stature but surprisingly sturdy. A native will
    carry a load of a hundred pounds for fifteen miles without showing
    signs of undue fatigue. The carrier supports the load on his back and
    it is held in place with a band or strap passed around the forehead.
    Occasionally the carriers stop and let down the loads, but never for
    more than a few moments. An Indian porter will trot upstairs with a
    trunk which an ordinary mortal could hardly budge and which, alone, he
    contrives somehow <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>to lift upon his back. I remember seeing two Indians
    carry a piano, supported on poles, for a distance of two blocks, with
    their customary gliding shuffle when carrying a burden. Had they at any
    time fallen out of step the piano must surely have been wrecked. This
    shuffle or trot is half-way between a walk and a run and it eats up
    distance.</p>

  <p>Not uncommonly the Mayas are handsome, with regular, delicate
    features. Some of the young women are very beautiful, even judged by
    North-American standards. They are mature at twelve years of age and,
    like the women of so many races of the tropics, they wither or grow
    fat at a comparatively early age. The color of the skin is about that
    of a good summer coat of tan, though possibly a bit more reddish in
    hue. Dress the average Maya in our mode and put him on any street in
    our country and he would pass without comment. On closer inspection he
    might be said to be of foreign ancestry, but certainly he would not be
    mistaken for a negro.</p>

  <p>These people, descendants of a truly great race, are decidedly superior
    to all other native American peoples. Their mentality is of a fairly
    high order. At first, in my visits to Yucatan, I had no knowledge of
    either the Spanish or the Maya tongue and when I had only natives for
    companions I was compelled to communicate with them by sign language
    made up on the spur of the moment. Even in the jungle my companions
    always understood my directions easily and carried them out correctly.</p>

  <p>The ordinary, every-day dress of the native men is a pair of
    white-cotton trousers ending half-way between knee and ankle. We should
    have difficulty in defining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> them either as long or as short. The upper
    garment is a short-sleeved undershirt, and the ensemble is topped off
    with almost any kind of straw hat. Usually they also wear a short
    blue-and-white-striped apron fastened about the waist. Wide belts are
    popular—the wider the better. Frequently the men go barefoot, but
    more often wear sandals, fastened with twine about the ankle, a string
    passing from the front of the sole and between the first and second
    toes. When working in the fields the men sometimes discard apron and
    trousers, wearing only a breech-clout and hat. Sometimes they let their
    hair grow long so that it falls over their faces and then even the hat
    is discarded. On Sundays and feast-days the more affluent, at least,
    blossom out in starched white trousers and jacket and high-heeled
    wooden sandals.</p>

  <p>The women customarily wear a <i>huipile</i>, which garment is neither a
    Mother-Hubbard nor a nightgown, but belongs, evidently, to the same
    genus or species. At any rate, it is sufficiently modest. It has a
    slightly low neck and short sleeves and reaches half-way from the knee
    to the ground. Beneath this is the <i>pic</i>, a white underskirt tied
    about the waist with a draw-string. Over all is worn the rebozo, a
    kind of shawl, and the native woman feels much ashamed if seen without
    this useless garment. Sandals may or may not be worn. The costume is
    always essentially the same. Sometimes the <i>huipile</i> is ornately and
    beautifully embroidered at the neck and on the sleeves. I am told that
    a girl will spend a year in embroidering a single <i>huipile</i> for her
    hope-chest. The garment is of ancient origin and I have seen murals in
    the ruined temples, painted centuries ago, which show women in just
    such embroidered garments, and at work making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> tortillas, which are
    still the main article of food in this land.</p>

  <p>Many of the Maya women wear gorgeously embroidered sandals or slippers.
    The hair is done up in a knot at the nape of the neck and tastefully
    fastened with a ribbon. Gold chains with various sorts of pendants,
    such as medallions of the Virgin Mary or crosses, are very popular.
    Frequently the Maya belle wears several of these chains. And they
    <em>must</em> be solid gold; plated stuff or alloy may not be worn. It simply
    isn’t done. In her native costume the Maya girl is very pretty and
    picturesque, but in European dress she resembles only a shapeless
    bundle tied in the middle.</p>

  <p>The Mayas are all very clean; the daily bath for men, women, and
    children is universal. A sort of wooden trough serves as a bath-tub as
    well as the family wash-tub. The bather pours the water over his body
    and makes a little water go a long way, because water must be carried
    by hand, usually from a distant well. For a man, even the humblest, to
    come home at the end of the day and find his bath unprepared is just
    cause for a rumpus with his wife. Clean bodies and clean clothes are
    characteristic of the Maya and much of the generally considered more
    civilized world might well take a lesson from him in this respect.</p>

  <p>The women stay at home and attend to their household tasks and take
    care of their numerous children while the men work in the fields.
    This custom is universal even among the laboring people, and it is
    noteworthy because nearly everywhere else in the world both women and
    men work in the fields. In fact, in many countries the man does the
    most resting.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

  <p>The Maya men are exceptionally fond of children and a widow with
    children stands an excellent chance of finding a stepfather for her
    brood. It is not uncommon for a man of twenty to marry a widow twice
    his age, chiefly for the sake of a ready-made family. Incidentally, the
    unmarried Maya maiden with a child or two, especially if the children
    are boys, is somewhat more likely to find a husband than her virgin
    sister. The fact that there may be some question as to the paternity of
    her offspring is of small consequence in the eyes of her prospective
    husband. But once married, she may accept no attentions from men other
    than her spouse. The husband may and does shoot on sight any cavalier
    found hanging around her. It used to be the custom to suspend a string
    of shells near the door, and one did not enter a house without giving
    due warning by shaking the string. A man did not enter at all unless
    the men of the family were present.</p>

  <p>Maya nature is that same human nature found the world over. If abused,
    these people can be ugly and vengeful. Treated in a reasonably decent
    manner, they are kindly, generous, hospitable, and scrupulously honest.
    Personally, I have never been cheated nor overcharged by a native. I
    suppose that as more and more tourists come to Yucatan the invidious
    custom of fleecing the traveler will be established here as it has been
    everywhere else.</p>

  <p>As has been said, water is scarce in this land, and frequently the
    women have to go long distances for even a jugful; yet they are always
    willing to share their supply with any one. The wayfarer is never
    turned away from their doors thirsty or hungry, even though he consume
    the last drop of water or bit of food in the house.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

  <p>The Indian met anywhere, in the woods or on the trail, invariably
    removes his hat and voices a polite greeting. There were employed at
    Chi-chen Itza, during much of Don Eduardo’s work, about one hundred
    Indians. It was their pleasant habit each evening about sunset to pass
    in line before the hacienda and bid us good night. The ceremony took
    place as they were returning from the little near-by church,—for all
    the natives at that time were good Catholics,—and we saw no more of
    them until dawn, which was our hour for beginning work.</p>

  <p>The modern Maya is devout, but he takes his religion placidly, leaving
    it to his spiritual adviser to tell him what to do or believe. In
    nearly every native hut is a shrine before which are dutifully observed
    the articles of faith—the faith of his conquerors who took away his
    galaxy of gods and substituted Catholicism.</p>

  <p>The Maya home is built much as it was in ancient times. It usually
    consists of but one large rectangular room. The foundation is of
    stone held together with plaster called <i lang="myn">zac-cab</i>, which means “white
    earth.” The walls are of poles or of stone plastered with <i lang="myn">zac-cab</i>.
    The roof is peaked and thatched with straw or with stiff palm-like
    leaves. The door is of wood and there is sometimes a window, barred
    but without glass. A wooden cover may be inserted from within to close
    this opening when desired. No matter how poor the Maya family, there is
    always a flower garden in the rear of the house. If his domain is very
    limited, the garden of the Maya may be reduced to what may be grown in
    a large-sized Standard-Oil can.</p>

  <p>Within, the Maya home is very simple. There are no beds as in ancient
    times; the native has adopted a Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> innovation, seeking his rest
    in a hammock suspended from wooden pegs set in the wall. The hammocks
    are taken down when not in use. A simple stool or two, a bench or a
    chest, possibly a table, and the ever-present shrine constitute the
    furniture. Not infrequently there is an American-made sewing-machine.
    The kitchen is outside, in another smaller building, and the stove
    consists merely of a crude stone oven or heap of stones. The bath-room
    and laundry, where there is a wooden trough to hold water, also is
    outdoors. At meal-times the family sits on stools about a pot or vessel
    containing the pièce de résistance, and the use of fingers is not
    frowned upon.</p>

  <p>The natives not resident in the towns or cities are for the most
    part employed on the haciendas, the majority of which are engaged in
    the raising of henequen. A few years ago there appeared a series of
    magazine articles, under some such heading as “Barbarous Mexico,”
    describing in the most approved yellow-journal style the cruelty and
    tyranny of the Mexican planters. I suppose there really are some
    isolated cases of cruelty, but in general the treatment of native
    workers by the plantation-owners leaves little to criticize. The
    native is free to leave one employer to seek another. His pay is good
    and he certainly is not overworked. On nearly every hacienda ample
    provision is made for entertainment and the fiestas and dances so
    dear to his heart. Many native families have lived and labored on
    one plantation for several generations—a fair indication that they
    are not ill-treated. One of the atrocities recited in the magazine
    articles just mentioned was the tying of an Indian to a post, where he
    was whipped severely. The whipping-post has existed, but its use was
    fostered by the Indians themselves <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>and was reserved for the habitual
    drunkard or him who repeatedly abused his wife and children. Possibly a
    similar course of treatment might be beneficial to some citizens of the
    United States.</p>

  <p>There was one unfortunate event, however, which reflected no credit on
    the natives, but for which they were far less to blame than a certain
    class of whites. Not long ago the creed of bolshevism was spread among
    these poor credulous people by a Rumanian fanatic, resulting in the
    murder of several plantation-owners and the burning of several estates.
    A few Indians at Don Eduardo’s hacienda, who had for some time failed
    to pay the slight rental required of them, became unruly and the master
    ordered them to pay up or leave. In reprisal they set fire to his
    house, Casa Real, and all the out-buildings, destroying many priceless
    antiquities intended for an American museum of archæology. The house
    has been rebuilt, but the lost treasures can never be replaced. The
    Indians also drove off all Don Eduardo’s stock and took everything in
    the way of valuables that was portable.</p>

  <p>Don Eduardo, in relating his experiences as a plantation-owner, once
    said:</p>

  <p>“A certain residue of Indians were never conquered by the Spaniards,
    nor have they ever been subdued by the Mexican Government; and they pay
    no taxes. They are called Sublevados and I have been warned ever since
    I came to Chi-chen Itza that some day the Sublevados would go on the
    war-path and wipe me and my hacienda clean off the map.</p>

  <p>“Eventually I became tired of waiting for them to visit me and enjoy
    the friendly reception I had prepared for them, which included, among
    other things, the fortifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> of the Great Pyramid. So I decided to
    make a little reconnaissance. Traveling south into their own country,
    I lived for some time in their villages, where they still practise the
    ancient Maya rites and incantations, even though there is a slight
    veneer of Catholicism among them. Since then I have traveled many times
    into the Sublevado territory; in fact, have been made a chief of the
    tribe by solemn bond and ritual. I have found them a peaceful, friendly
    lot of ignorant Indians, unlikely to do any harm as long as they are
    left to their own devices and in their present habitat.”</p>

  <p>The Maya is happy-go-lucky, improvident, and usually lazy. He dearly
    loves a good time, a good story, and a good joke, especially if it is
    of the practical variety in which the other fellow is the butt. He is
    very fond of fiestas and dances.</p>

  <p>The native dances are quite different from ours. The men and women sit
    close to the walls of the hut or inclosure, sometimes on chairs but
    more often on stools. On important occasions, the music is furnished
    by violins, guitars, and perhaps some wind-instruments. But always
    there is one musician with a long gourd containing stones, which is
    shaken in time to the music, producing a hollow <em>chuck-a-chuck</em>,
    <em>chuck-a-chuck</em> sound. Sometimes the only instrument is a flageolet.
    The music is always in a minor key and is without pause or period or
    end. A girl—any girl—gets up and proceeds to the center of the floor,
    where she shuffles about for perhaps a minute. Then from the other end
    of the room some man, who may be a stranger to the girl, comes forth
    and shuffles about in front of her. They do not touch each other. They
    gyrate rather slowly and move in circles, always facing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> each other.
    When either becomes weary, he or she retires and another takes up the
    dance. If the room is sufficiently large there may be as many as three
    couples dancing continuously in this manner. The dancers do not smile
    nor appear to be enjoying the occasion; yet they must derive pleasure
    from it, for throughout the country dances are held frequently.</p>

  <p>Knowing the Mayas of to-day, and their customs, it is interesting
    to follow their history back to the earliest times of which there
    is authentic record, and from there, through legends and scraps of
    knowledge, into their most ancient past. For four centuries we may
    trace them backward through well-known history. For still another
    century the record is fairly clear. Back of that is only legend, with
    here and there some startling, incontrovertible fact to prove their
    antiquity. The flickering light of our knowledge becomes dimmer and
    dimmer. We know a date in their history about one hundred years before
    Christ, but on what preceded that no feeblest ray falls to enlighten
    our ignorance.</p>

  <p>To one man, long since departed, we owe a great debt. But for him, our
    knowledge of the ancient Mayas would be almost nil, and it is only by a
    lucky chance that what he wrote was not lost to us. This man, Diego de
    Landa, was Bishop of Yucatan (1573-79), and he came to America on the
    heels of the Spanish conquerors. His manuscript,—almost our only guide
    to Maya antiquity and known as “Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan,”—lay
    hidden in Madrid for nearly three hundred years ere it was discovered
    and published.</p>

  <p>To show how little the Mayas have changed in four centuries I am going
    to quote from Landa, using a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> free translation but endeavoring
    to preserve his meaning. I hope the reader will bear in mind that the
    following is a description of the Mayas of the sixteenth century and is
    chiefly interesting when compared with the Mayas of to-day:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Indians of Yucatan are well built, tall and robust. They
      are generally bow-legged, because mothers customarily carry
      infants astride their hips. It is considered a mark of beauty
      to be cross-eyed. The heads and foreheads are flat, having been
      bound in infancy. Their ears are pierced for ear-rings and are
      torn by the sacrifices. The men do not have beards and it is
      said the mothers burn their boys’ faces with hot cloths so
      that hair does not grow. Some do have beards, but these are
      very stiff, like the bristles of a pig. The men permit the hair
      of the head to grow long except on top, where they burn it off.
      Thus the hair of the crown is short, but the remainder is long
      and is braided and wound like a wreath around the head, leaving
      a small tail in the back as tassels or tufts.</p>

    <p>Their dress is a strip of cloth about as wide as a hand and
      wound several times about the waist, with one end hanging in
      front and the other in the back. The women adorn these ends
      curiously with feathers. They wear large square blankets, which
      they fasten to their shoulders, and sandals of hemp or deerskin.</p>

    <p>They bathe a great deal and do not try to hide their nudity
      from the women, except with their hands. The men use mirrors
      and the women do not. The expression for cuckoldom is that the
      wife has put the mirror in her husband’s hair above the occiput.</p>

    <p>Their houses are roofed with straw or palm-leaves and the roof
      has a considerable slant. They put a wall lengthwise through
      the middle of the house and in it some doors. In the back half
      are the beds and the other section is whitewashed and is the
      reception room for guests. This room is like a porch, the whole
      front being open and without a door. The roof over this part of
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
      the house extends well down over the walls, to keep out sun
      and rain. The common people build the houses of the chiefs and
      house-breaking is considered a grave crime. Beds are made of
      small rods with a mat and cotton blankets on top. In summer the
      men especially sleep in the open room or porch, on mats.</p>

    <p>All the people unite in cultivating the fields of the chief
      and supplying food to his household. In hunting, fishing, or
      bringing salt, a share is always given to the chief. If the
      chief dies he is succeeded by his eldest son, but his other
      descendants are respected and helped. The subordinate chiefs
      help in all things, according to their stations. The priests
      live from their offices and from the offerings given to them.
      The chiefs rule the town, settle disputes, and govern all
      affairs. The principal chiefs travel a great deal and take much
      company with them. They visit rich people, where they arrange
      the affairs of the villages, transacting their principal
      business at night.</p>

    <p>The Indians tattoo their bodies, believing that they become
      more valiant thereby. The process is painful, as the designs
      are painted on the body and then pricked in with a small
      poniard. Because of the pain the tattooing is done only a
      little at a time, and also because the tattooed part becomes
      inflamed and matterated, causing sickness. Those who are not
      tattooed are ridiculed. The natives like to be flattered and
      they like to imitate the Castilian graces and customs and
      to eat and drink as we do. They are fond of sweet odors and
      employ bouquets of flowers and sweet-smelling herbs. They are
      accustomed to paint their faces and bodies red, which does not
      improve their appearance but which they consider beautifying.</p>

    <p>They are very dissolute in getting drunk, from which follow
      many evils such as murder, arson, rape and incest.... They
      are fond of recreation, especially of dances and of plays
      containing many jokes and witticisms. They sometimes become
      servants for a time in a Spanish household just to absorb
      the conversation and customs and these are later artfully
      represented in native plays.</p>

    <p>Their musical instruments are small kettle-drums played with
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
      the hand and another drum made of hollow wood, played with
      a wooden stick containing on the end a ball made of the milk
      of a certain tree [rubber]. They have long, slender trumpets
      fashioned from hollow sticks with gourds fastened at one end.
      Another instrument is made from a whole turtle-shell, which is
      played with the palm of the hand and emits a melancholy sound.
      They have whistles and flutes of reed or bones of the deer and
      from large snail-shells. These instruments are played for their
      war-dances. One of these dances is called <i lang="myn">co-lom-che</i>, meaning
      reed. A large circle of men is formed. Two go into the center.
      One has a handful of darts and while dancing in an upright
      position he casts the darts with all his strength at the second
      dancer, who dances in a squatting position, from which he
      deftly catches each dart with a small stick. After the darts
      are all thrown, these two dancers return to their original
      places in the circle and two new dancers advance to the center
      and repeat the dart-throwing. There is another war-dance in
      which about eight hundred men take part. They carry flags and
      the tempo is slow. They dance the whole day without stopping
      and during the whole day not one man gets out of step. In no
      case do the men dance with the women.</p>

    <p>There are many occupations but the people most incline toward
      trading, taking salt, clothing, and slaves to the lands of Ulna
      and Tabasco, where they exchange for cocoa and counters of
      stone which are their money. With these coins they buy slaves,
      or the chiefs wear them as jewels at feasts. They have other
      counters and jewelry made of certain shells. These are carried
      in purses made of network. In the markets are all manner of
      goods. They loan money without usury and pay their debts with
      good-will. Some Indians are potters and carpenters who are
      well paid for the idols of wood and clay which they make.
      There are surgeons—or, rather, wizards—who cure with herbs
      and incantations. Above all, there are laborers and those who
      plant and gather the corn and other produce which they store in
      granaries to be sold in season. They have no mules or oxen.</p>

    <p>The Indians have the good custom of helping one another in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
      all their work. In working the land they do nothing from the
      middle of January to April except gather manure and burn it.
      Then come the rains and they plant the fields, using a small
      pointed stick to poke holes into the ground in each of which
      they deposit five or six seeds which grow very rapidly in this
      rainy season. They also congregate in groups of about fifty for
      hunting or fishing.</p>

    <p>When going on a visit, the Indian takes a present to his host
      and the host gives the guest a present of proportionate value.
      They are generous and hospitable. They give food and drink to
      all who come to their houses.</p>

    <p>They take much pride in their lineage, especially if they are
      descendants of some ancient family of Mayapan and they boast of
      the distinguished men who have been of their family. The whole
      name of the father is always borne by his sons, but not by
      his daughters. But the children, both sons and daughters, are
      called by the compound names of father and mother, in which the
      name of the father is the given name and that of the mother the
      surname. Thus the son of Chel and Chan would be Na-Chan-Chel,
      which means son of Chel by his wife Chan. A stranger coming to
      a village, especially if he be poor, will be received in all
      kindness by any family of his name. Men and women of the same
      name do not marry, for this is considered very wrong.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER II<br />
      <span class="small">THE CHURCH OF SAN ISIDRO AND ITS FRAGRANT LEGEND</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">“ONE particularly lovely Sunday morning, some time after taking up
    my abode at Chi-chen Itza,” says Don Eduardo, “I was awakened, as on
    other occasions, by the softly melodious chiming of the bells in my
    little church on the hill. As I lay in my hammock, idly listening to
    the pleasant sound, I could distinguish the different tones of the
    several bells and it was a pleasant thought to me to know that I had
    equipped the little church with bells having a superior quality of
    tone. The sound of them was indeed delightful because while church
    bells in Yucatan are as plentiful as millionaires in Pittsburgh, they
    are usually cracked and raucous.</p>

  <p>“It was still early when I stood before my manor and turned my gaze
    eastward toward the little stone church perched cozily on a near-by
    gently sloping hillside. Both my manor and the little church had for
    many years been in ruins, unused. Extensive repairs had just been
    completed on both, to make them habitable. Here and there one of my
    Indians, or a whole family, dressed in their Sunday best, were already
    churchward bound, and the chimes continued softly to remind the
    laggard of his duty. The red rim of the sun was just peeping over the
    horizon behind the church, while the birds in every tree and thicket
    were voicing their welcome to this glorious new day. A lazy, blissful
    breeze laden with the mingled scents of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> thousand tropic blossoms
    ruffled the tree-tops. Before me stretched a vista of wildly beautiful
    country-side with no sign of the handiwork of man other than the little
    church. No towering peaks, no gushing streams, no bottomless cañons
    greeted my eye; merely a terrain that is just saved from being flat.
    Yet it is all divinely lovely—a study in green and blue with here and
    there a spot of flaming color. The cloudless sky was of so clear and
    vivid a blue that I was tempted to stand on tiptoe and take down a
    handful. Foliage of some sort covered every inch of ground and was of
    every imaginable shade of green, from the shadowed purple-green where
    the rising sun had not penetrated, to the pale green of some of the
    tree-tops, turned golden in the first slanting rays. A gorgeous parrot
    flashed from tree to tree and disappeared and by his flight brought my
    eye to rest on a riot of flame-flower high up in a distant tree.</p>

  <p>“The sudden silence of the bells warned me that if I too intended to
    go to church there was no time to lose. My little stone church is
    not without fame, for in its then-abandoned sacristy that remarkable
    traveler and historian John L. Stephens made his abode when he visited
    my City of the Sacred Well. It was here that he wrote his notes on ‘The
    Ruined City of Chi-chen Itza.’ Though it has been repaired, it looks
    almost as he left it one cloudy Sunday morning nearly eighty years ago.
    Its cut-stone walls and bell-tower are the same, but its old roof,
    bowed with age, has been replaced with a fine new thatch of palm.</p>

  <p>“San Isidro is the patron saint of the plantation—for no
    well-organized plantation is without its patron saint, whose image is
    venerated by all the natives there employed. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>The image of San Isidro
    in this little church on the hill at Chi-chen Itza is of unknown
    antiquity and is believed to be possessed of miraculous powers which
    are constantly manifested. Veneration for the image, together with
    the attraction of the three-belled chimes swinging in their places
    in the tiny tower, makes the little church a sacred spot not only
    to the people of my hacienda but likewise to the inhabitants of the
    near-by village of Pisté and the region for many miles around. Has not
    the sacred image and the big stone baptismal font been used by the
    archbishop himself? Was not Mat-Ek healed, who was blinded for many
    months by the vapor from the <i lang="myn">ikeban</i> plant, blown into his eyes by the
    wind while he was gathering his crops? Was he not given back his sight
    in less than a week after he had prayed for aid and kissed the feet of
    San Isidro? And did not Mat-Ek, in token of his gratitude, have made an
    eye of pure silver and give it to the sainted image—an eye which now
    hangs over the altar for all to see? What more can you ask?</p>

  <p>“The church was filled to overflowing in token of a great and special
    day, for it is only occasionally that the regularly ordained priest
    comes all the way from Valladolid, and confessions, christenings, and
    marriage bans await his coming.</p>

  <p>“As the congregation slowly drifts into place, the gentle rustling
    of the unstarched <i lang="myn">huipiles</i> and <i lang="myn">pics</i> of the women and the louder
    rustling of the stiffly starched trousers and jackets of the men sound
    remarkably like the lapping of summer wavelets upon a sandy beach. The
    soft laughter of the children outside the building, mingled with the
    restrained voices of admonishing Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> elders, all combine to create
    an atmosphere in perfect accord with the surroundings and the low-toned
    service. Within the chapel many candles of wild beeswax give forth
    soft lights and heavy odors which, mingling with the fragrant smoke of
    incense, fall with pleasant, soporific effect upon the congregation.</p>

  <p>“The chimes ring their tuneful, familiar message—a message come down
    the centuries since the Child of Bethlehem was born in a manger; a
    message brought across the seas to this little stone church, by some
    unknown, long-departed padre. The solemn peals roll out and up to those
    gray old temples of another faith, wherein the sacred music of the
    ancient Mayas, the sound of <i lang="myn">tunkul</i>, or priestly drum, and <i lang="myn">dzacatan</i>,
    once beat in pulsing chorus. These sound symbols of the Sacred Cross
    are wafted to the altars, still standing, of the Sacred Serpent, whose
    creed once reigned supreme over this land.</p>

  <p>“The beloved priest begins the age-old intoned creed and as the
    service lengthens through the chants, singing, and sermon, there
    comes a penetrating, strangely sweet odor. Stronger and stronger it
    grows, filling the church and floating out into the morning air. The
    worshipers nod their heads. ‘The <i lang="myn">xmehen macales</i> have blossomed;
    God is good to us,’ they murmur. Six graceful, big-leafed plants
    like large calla-lilies had been placed upon the altar, among other
    flowering plants. And as I look, the six white buds of these lilies,
    each slenderly sheathed in green, open slowly to the light, revealing
    blooms of creamy white. They open in unison, as if at the bidding of an
    unheard voice. To me it is startling, uncanny. And here is the story
    about them that met my eager questions at the close of the service:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

  <p>“Francisco Tata de las Fuentas, caballero of Castile, blue-eyed and
    yellow-haired, was fair of skin as a Saxon. In his youth he was as hot
    of blood and of head as a Gascon and traveled the pace with the best
    and worst of Castile and all the adjoining provinces. His offerings to
    Venus, to Bacchus, and to the little gods of chance were so fervid and
    frequent that they soon caused his real castle in Castile to become
    as those common ones of the air. And his broad lands on the banks of
    the Guadiana passed to more careful guardians. When nothing remained
    to him but his horse, Selim, he betook himself with Hernan Cortes to
    New Spain. Here, under Cortes, he learned discretion bought by hard
    experience, so that he acquired some wealth. With Francisco de Montejo,
    trusted friend and lieutenant of Cortes, he came to Yucatan, received a
    royal grant of land with many natives, and took to himself a wife, the
    lovely and virtuous daughter of a native chief or <i lang="myn">batab</i>.</p>

  <p>“Time passed and he was gathered to his fathers, leaving an only
    child, a son named for him. The second Francisco Fuentes inherited
    the father’s fair skin and bold blue eyes, as well as the gorgeous
    gold-and-silver trappings of the once fiery Selim, not to mention half
    a dozen big plantations, houses and lands in Valladolid and Mérida, and
    scores of minor holdings in several other towns and villages.</p>

  <p>“This Francisco Fuentes, or Pancho as his friends called him, had
    two sons and a daughter. The sons were stalwart, upstanding fellows,
    recalling in their stature and temper their Spanish ancestry, but
    showing in their brown skins the admixture of native blood of mother
    and grandmother.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

  <p>“Maria, the one beloved daughter, had the plump figure and the sweet
    temper of her mother, but her proud little head was covered with a
    wealth of yellow hair and her eyes were of clearest blue, the dauntless
    eyes of the first Francisco. And now Maria, the idol of her father and
    worshiped by her brothers, darling of the whole village, was slowly
    dying; wasting away with a strange fever that could not be abated.
    By day her body was cool and her brain clear, but with the setting
    sun came the fever that defied all skill of physicians and nurses. At
    midnight her frail, fair form was shaken with ague and burned with a
    fever almost to sear the hands of those who ministered to her as she
    tossed in delirium. Wasted to a shadow, Maria seemed beckoned by the
    Grim Reaper.</p>

  <p>“The sun again touched the western horizon. The sorrowing family,
    father and brothers, were at her bedside. Friends and neighbors
    gathered to watch over the last hours of the helpless little sufferer,
    for there seemed no hope. A knock sounded at the door, hesitant, timid,
    as of supplication.</p>

  <p>“‘It is but one of the beggars who constantly impose on Maria,’ said a
    sharp-tongued watcher, peering through the window into the dusk.</p>

  <p>“Maria, restlessly turning in her hammock in an inner room, heard the
    knocking and the words of the watcher.</p>

  <p>“‘I think,’ whispered she, ‘it is old X-Euan, come for some milk I
    promised her for her orphan grandchild. Fill with milk the clean flask
    which is on the shelf behind the door and give it to her.’</p>

  <p>“Old X-Euan took the flask of milk, but from her lips did not come the
    whining thanks of the mendicant. Instead, from beneath the tattered
    folds of her shawl, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> brought forth a vase of strange antique make,
    in which was growing a broad-leafed plant with a single swelling bud at
    its center. Handing the plant to the watcher, the old Maya woman said:</p>

  <p>“‘Take this to Maria; place it close by her with the blessing of one
    to whom she has done as her kind heart, guided by God, has told her to
    do.’ In her voice was a note of command which brought obedience from
    those who heard. Old X-Euan departed, but some—those who were nearest
    and so should have seen clearest—insisted that a faint glow like a
    halo enveloped her head.</p>

  <p>“The hour of twilight had passed. The dreaded time of the quickened
    pulse and panting delirium had come. Maria lay tossing in her hammock.
    Close by her the virgin petals of the flower began slowly to unfold.
    A fragrance, at first almost imperceptible, was wafted through the
    room. As the blossom opened to full bloom and its perfume permeated the
    sick-room, the restless turnings, the feverish mutterings grew less and
    less and at last ceased altogether. A dewy moisture appeared on Maria’s
    pallid forehead and she sank into deep, refreshing slumber.</p>

  <p>“Amid the rejoicing there was a note of awed wonder, for in the very
    center of the flower the beautiful calyx seemed to have taken the fever
    heat that was Maria’s, and as her fever abated the heat in the heart of
    the flower increased, until at midnight it was almost incandescent.</p>

  <p>“A week passed. Each night, so the watchers told, the flower took to
    itself the heat of the fever, while Maria, feverless, slept soundly.
    And on the morning of the eighth day she was convalescent. But the
    beautiful blossom was but a withered, brown, shapeless nothing.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

  <p>“‘<i lang="fr">La flor de la calentura</i> has performed its task,’ exclaimed the
    joyful natives, but Maria, lovely once more with returning strength,
    said, ‘Alas! <i lang="fr">La flor de la calentura</i>, the flower that saved my life,
    is dead.’</p>

  <p>“And thus it was told by Maria to her grandchildren and retold by them
    to their grandchildren and is now known by every one in the region.
    Surely it must be true! Why shouldn’t it be? At any rate, it is
    accepted as literally by my Indians as the less pleasing story of Jonah
    and the whale.”</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IT has been said that civilization is but a layer-cake of eras—a
    building up of strata, with the brute state at the bottom. Layer upon
    layer, each succeeding generation adds its small bit of culture or
    knowledge, until a golden age is finally reached. And, sadly enough,
    from that age of enlightenment, the hope of the world, there has always
    been a rapid decline, until centuries later, perhaps, again begins the
    tedious gradual uplift.</p>

  <p>And the story of man’s rise and fall, in the passing of the ages,
    usually is buried in the earth, to be laid bare to our eyes if we have
    but the patience to find and the ability to understand. Just as a good
    woodsman can read from a scratch on a tree or a faint footprint on the
    ground things not obvious to the untrained observer, our men of science
    have developed remarkable expertness in divining the history of bygone
    eras from the scanty traces that remain. From a skull, centuries buried
    in a cave, they reconstruct the Neanderthal man. The fragments of an
    earthen pot tell them the degree of culture and the period of him who
    once supped from the vessel.</p>

  <p>Wherever there are caves there is the likelihood of uncovering vestiges
    of aboriginal life, for primitive men everywhere used caverns, either
    as temporary shelters or as permanent abodes. Beneath the cave floor
    may be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> evidence of many generations of men—the relics buried in
    layers one upon another as the discarded and broken implements of one
    generation were trampled underfoot and submerged under the charred
    embers and rubbish of the succeeding one.</p>

  <p>The written record of the Mayas gives but little clue to their
    origin and no indication at all of their descent from more barbarous
    ancestors. Did these people, already of a high state of culture,
    immigrate from some other land? If so, were they the first comers or
    did they find the country even then inhabited? Or were their ancestors
    natives of this region for hundreds of centuries before them?</p>

  <p>Yucatan is a land of caverns, veritably a honeycomb of caves, and
    eagerly the paleontologist rolled up his sleeves, shouldered his
    shovel, and set out to find the answer to these vexing questions.
    The answer was found and is conclusive but disappointing. Beyond the
    question of a doubt, the Mayas brought with them their culture, and
    they were the first inhabitants of this country. Whence they came, or
    how, or why; from what race they sprang, we know not and probably never
    shall know. A few conflicting legends of their arrival as recorded in
    some old Maya writings constitute the sum total of our knowledge on
    this point.</p>

  <p>Many intricately derived meanings of the name <em>Maya</em> have been offered.
    The most obvious, however, is the direct translation. <i lang="myn">Ma</i> means
    “not” and <i lang="myn">ya</i> means “emotion,” “grief,” “tiresome,” or “difficult.”
    The combination means, “not arduous,” “not severe.” We know that the
    Mayas frequently alluded to their country as the Land of the Deer and
    the Land of the Wild Turkey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>— <i lang="myn">U-Lumil-Ceh</i>, <i lang="myn">U-Lumil-Cutz</i>. “Maya,”
    therefore, may quite likely have been descriptive of the region as a
    pleasant, comfortable place of residence. Juan Martinez, who knows the
    Indian and the language, present and past, as no one else, once said to
    me: “Work and grief are synonymous to the native mind. Work is grief to
    the Indian; therefore a land of no grief and no sorrow may well mean
    a land of no work.” However, any explanation of the derivation of so
    ancient a name is little more than surmise.</p>

  <p>According to one myth, the Mayas came over the sea from the east, under
    the leadership of a hero-deity, Itzamna; hence the name “Itzas” as
    applied to a part, at least, of the Mayas. In the Maya books Itzamna is
    represented as an old man with one tooth and a sunken jaw. His glyph or
    sign is his pictured profile, together with a sign of night, the sign
    of food, and two or three feathers.</p>

  <p>The more credible legend refers to an immigration from the west or
    north, under a chieftain named Kukul Can. There are reasons for
    believing that this legend may be founded upon fact. It is mentioned
    in several of the most ancient of the surviving Maya records and in
    the testimony of a number of well-versed natives at the time of the
    Conquest. Farther up the coast, north of Vera Cruz, is another branch
    of the Maya family called the Huastecs, while in Central America,
    through Honduras, Guatemala, and even in Costa Rica, are present-day
    Maya tribes and ruins of ancient Maya civilization. Also, there is a
    close similarity between the Kukul Can legend and the Aztec annals,
    indicating a common origin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> Everything points to the probability of a
    remote great migration of their common ancestors from the north.</p>

  <p>The Aztec tradition is particularly interesting and describes the
    arrival by boat of several different tribes at the mouth of the Panuco
    River, which spot the Aztecs called Panatolan, meaning “where one
    arrives by sea.” The expedition was headed by the supreme leader,
    Mexitl, chief of the Mexicans, with whom were other chieftains and
    their followers. They traveled on down the coast as far as Guatemala,
    and some turned back and settled at various places along the shore.
    On this journey an intoxicating drink was originated by one Mayanel,
    whose name means “clever woman.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There is a possibility that “Maya”
    is derived from her name. At any rate, one tribal chief, Huastecatl,
    imbibed too freely and cast aside his garments while intoxicated. His
    shame was so great when he realized what he had done that he gathered
    his tribe, the Huastecas, and returned with them to Panatolan and
    settled there.</p>

  <p>Landa says in his book that some old men of Yucatan related to him
    the story, handed down for many generations, that the first settlers
    had come from the east by water. These voyagers were ones “whom God
    had freed, opening for them twelve roads to the sea.” If there is any
    truth in this tradition, these progenitors may have been one of the
    lost tribes of Israel. An interesting side light on this hypothesis
    is the distinctly Semitic cast of countenance of some of the ancient
    sculptures and murals <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>found at Chi-chen Itza and in other old Maya
    cities. The dignity of face and serene poise of these carved or painted
    likenesses is strikingly Hebraic.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

  <p>While we are in the field of conjecture, we may as well consider the
    old Greek myth of the lost continent of Atlantis. From the geological
    point of view, it is not impossible. The whole of Yucatan is low and
    was once the bottom of the sea, as is indicated by its surface rock
    and sand. Furthermore, the stretching out of the Antilles as though to
    form a bridge with the Azores, and the shallowness of the intervening
    Atlantic Ocean, lends plausibility to the idea that there may have been
    a cataclysmic upheaval of the ocean-bed during some past era, and not
    long ago, geologically speaking—an upheaval which created the land of
    Yucatan and caused what was land to the eastward to sink beneath the
    level of the Atlantic. What is more natural to suppose than that in
    some prehistoric period the lost continent of Atlantis did exist and
    proved an easy means of passage between Europe and America?</p>

  <p>The mist-enshrouded history of the migrations of ancient people, the
    crossing and recrossing of their pilgrimages and of their blood, is a
    fascinating study, but one which tells us comparatively little that may
    be crystallized into fact. And so, in these various speculations as to
    the origin of the Mayas, no theory contains enough weight of evidence
    to warrant the assumption that it is the right one. It is, however,
    pretty clearly established <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>from the ancient Maya writings and legends
    that there were two main immigrations, the greater one coming from the
    west or north and the lesser one from the east.</p>

  <p>Emerging at last from the purely legendary, we reach the middle ground
    where the history of the Mayas is still unrecorded but where the word
    of mouth, as handed down from father to son, is more precise and
    has some relation to definite dates. Then we suddenly step over the
    threshold into the historical era.</p>

  <p>The first recorded date, which corresponds to 113 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, is
    on a statuette from the ancient city of Tuxtla, and there is some
    doubt as to whether our reading of this date is correct. The next
    inscription corresponds to 47 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and here we are on sure
    ground. A monument in northern Guatemala contains a date prior to
    160 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, at which point the ancient Maya Codices take up
    the history of the race and carry it on to the time of the Conquest.
    And even at this early time, the Mayas had hieroglyphic writings
    and were skilled in stone-carving and the erection of massive works
    of architecture. With the written Chronicles, the many hieroglyphed
    stones,—“precious stones,” I like to call them,—and the history of
    progress as indicated by the different periods of architecture and
    sculpture, we are able to verify and correlate most of the subsequent
    dates.</p>

  <p>The written Maya records, without which our task of piecing together
    anything of their history would be almost impossible, are among the
    most interesting and valuable remains of this bygone civilization. The
    records are of two kinds. The first, the Codices, are the original
    texts, written in hieroglyphics. The second, the Chilan Balam, are
    written in the Maya language but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> with Spanish characters, and are
    chiefly transcripts from the more ancient records.</p>

  <p>Only three hieroglyphic Codices have survived, and they are known
    respectively as the Dresden Codex, the Perez Codex, and the
    Tro-Cortesianus. All are in European museums and many facsimile
    reproductions have been made of them for use in other museums and
    libraries. These manuscripts are painstakingly illuminated by hand,
    in colors, and were done with some sort of brush, possibly of hair
    or feathers. They are done on paper or, rather, a sort of cardboard
    which has been given a smooth white surface through the application
    of a coating of fine lime. The body of the paper is made of the fiber
    of the maguey plant. The manuscript is folded like a Japanese screen
    or a railway time-table. According to early accounts, some of these
    records were also made on tanned or otherwise prepared deerskin and
    upon bark. None of the hide or bark records has ever been found by
    present-day explorations. It is known that the Mayas had many records
    concerning religious history, religious rites and ceremonies, medicine,
    and astronomy. The Spanish priests caused all of the Maya writings they
    could find to be gathered together and burned, in the fanatical belief
    that they were serving the church by so doing.</p>

  <p>If only their bigotry had vented itself in some other way, how much
    these old manuscripts might have told us! Apropos of the burning of
    the priceless documents Landa says, “We collected all the native books
    we could find and burned them, much to the sorrow of the people, and
    caused them pain.”</p>

  </div>

  <p>The group of books called the Chilan Balam, which are chiefly
    ideographic transcripts of the more ancient works, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>written in the Maya
    tongue but in Spanish characters, probably were made surreptitiously
    by some of the educated natives soon after the Conquest. There are
    sixteen of these books still extant. The meaning of this Maya name,
    <i lang="myn">Chilan Balam</i>, is interesting. <i lang="myn">Chi</i> means “mouth”; <i lang="myn">lan</i> indicates
    action. Therefore <i lang="myn">Chilan</i> is “mouth action,” or “speech.” <i lang="myn">Balam</i>
    is synonymous for either “tiger” or “ferocity.” But the tiger was
    worshiped as a deity and the combination of the words, <i lang="myn">Chilan Balam</i>,
    means “Speech of the Gods.” The Maya priests were sometimes called by
    the name, indicating that they were the mouthpieces of the gods, and
    doubtless these records took their name from the priestly appellation.</p>

  <p>The individual books of the Chilan Balam are known by the names of
    the villages in which they were found, and in a few cases the name of
    the village may have been derived from the presence of the book. The
    most important of these books are Nabula, Chun-may-el (which means
    “something of the first” or “original”), Kua, Man, X-kutz-cab, Ixil,
    Tihosuco, and Tixcocob.</p>

  <p>Just when these books were written is not known, but there is evidence
    that the book of Mani was written prior to 1595 and the book of Nabula
    tells of an epidemic which occurred in 1663. While teaching the
    natives to write the Maya language in Spanish characters, Bishop Landa
    employed a rather original method, which is our only key to reading
    these writings and which serves as our only clue to the more ancient
    hieroglyphs. The ancient Maya writings were purely picture writings,
    but to some extent the hieroglyphs had lost their original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> picture
    significance and had come to have a somewhat symbolic meaning.</p>

  <p>In arranging the so-called Maya alphabet (which was first used by the
    priests in writing out the prayers for the Mayas), Landa employed a
    very ingenious method and one that was practical at the time. He took
    the Spanish alphabet and beginning with “A” he asked the educated
    Indian to draw the character for him in which the sound of “A” was
    predominant. Naturally, after many attempts by the Indian to furnish
    such a character he finally selected the hieroglyph <i lang="myn">ac</i>, which is a
    picture of a turtle’s head and which in Maya means “turtle” or “dwarf”
    or something having a slow movement. Next he took the letter “B” and
    eventually chose the character <i lang="myn">be</i>, which means “road,” “walk,” “run,”
    and consists of the picture of a footprint. Therefore—not to go into a
    lengthy description of the system—he had “A” from <i lang="myn">ac</i>, “B” from <i lang="myn">be</i>,
    etc. With this extemporized alphabet the priests were able to write out
    the Catholic prayers in such a way that the Indian could repeat them in
    Spanish by using the sound of the first part of his hieroglyph for the
    sound of each Spanish letter.</p>

  <p>It may be seen from the foregoing that Landa’s alphabet cannot be used
    for translating Maya, for when the hieroglyphs are made to represent
    the sounds of the Spanish alphabet the result does not indicate the
    original connection of a Maya word with its glyph. This fact was a
    great disappointment among archæologists, who at first expected to
    translate the Maya Codices by the use of the Landa alphabet. Their
    hopes, however, were short-lived and they even pronounced Landa an
    impostor. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> the contrary, he has unintentionally given us what is
    almost a Rosetta Stone.</p>

  <p>The Codices, I fear, will never yield a connected story, as they are
    written in a stenographic or shorthand style consisting of disconnected
    sentences.</p>

  <p>Many of the stones, or <i lang="la">stelæ</i>, may contain history, and as soon as
    we know the meanings of, possibly, a thousand glyphs we shall be able
    to make a decided advance in the art of reading the books. Landa in
    his book explains not the Maya glyphs but the way the priests used
    these Maya characters for religious purposes. For example, he says
    <i lang="myn">Ma-in-kati</i> means “I do not want,” represented in the ancient Maya by
    three simple glyphs. Written as the priests had arranged, with a glyph
    for each sound of a Spanish letter, the result is a combination of five
    glyphs, which, if given their original Maya pictured meanings, leads to
    the rather surprising knowledge that “no dead animal was seen at this
    place,” or, literally, “not see tail [animal] death place.”</p>

  <p>Besides the Codices and the Chilan Balam, which together are frequently
    alluded to as the Maya Chronicles, there are some other documents such
    as titles to land, records of surveys, etc. There is a unique history
    of the Conquest, written by a contemporary native chief called Na Kuk
    Pech, whose name means “house of the feathered wood-tick.” The story
    was written in the native language, by means of Spanish characters, and
    has been translated recently by Señor Juan Martinez, whose profound
    knowledge of the Maya language has eminently fitted him for this task.</p>

  <p>The history of Chi-chen Itza is of especial interest because this was
    the Holy City, the Mecca of all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> ancient Maya people. According
    to the Maya Chronicles, one or several tribes set out from a place
    called Nonual, in 160 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and apparently spent many years
    in aimless wandering, arriving finally, in 241 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, at a
    place they named Chac Nouitan. Then follows a gap in our knowledge and
    the next we learn of these people is that in 445 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, while
    they were residing at a place called Bak-Halal, they heard of Chi-chen
    Itza. It is clear that Chi-chen Itza was already an inhabited city at
    that time. Soon after this, these tribes moved to Chi-chen Itza, where
    they lived until about 600 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, when, for some unaccountable
    reason, they abandoned it utterly and migrated to the land of Chan Kan
    Putun. And this residence was in turn abandoned two hundred and sixty
    years later, because of some calamity; one Chronicle speaks of a great
    fire.</p>

  <p>For nearly a hundred years, to quote from the Chronicles, “the Itzas
    lived in exile and great distress under the trees and under the
    branches.” Then, some of them reëstablished Chi-chen Itza in 950
    <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, while others founded the city of Uxmal or went to
    Mayapan. The second residence lasted for some two hundred years. About
    1200 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the Itzas, under the ruler Ulumil, invaded the city
    of Mayapan and at about this same time Chi-chen Itza was attacked and
    depopulated by foreigners—in all probability the Nahuas (Mexicans),
    who came down from the north. The last event alluded to in the
    Chronicles is the coming of the Spaniards under Montejo, who found the
    Mayas already decadent and their cities long ruined and abandoned.</p>

  <p>We have no authentic description of the actual condition of Chi-chen
    Itza when the Spaniards came, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> it is known with certainty that Tiho
    (place of the five temples), one of the ancient cities, the site of the
    modern city of Mérida, was in ruins. The temples were dilapidated and
    overgrown with vegetation and great trees were rooted in the walls. The
    few inhabitants living around these ruins knew virtually nothing of the
    founders of the city, nor of those who had lived there when it was in
    its prime.</p>

  <p>At the coming of the Spaniards to Chi-chen Itza, about 1541, the city
    was inhabited by a few people who were, I think, nothing more than
    campers—inferior people using as shelters the buildings which they had
    found there and of whose history they were quite ignorant.</p>

  <p>While it has no place in this book, the last known migration of some of
    the Mayas is interesting and it is certain that a considerable number
    emigrated between the years 1450 and 1451 southward to Lake Peten,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
    where they built a city on an island and there they survived, together
    with their ancient culture, until conquered in 1697 by the Spaniards,
    who destroyed all their temples and books and perforce made either good
    Christians or “good Indians” of all the inhabitants.</p>

  <p>Landa says, under the heading, “Various Misfortunes Experienced in
    Yucatan in the Century before the Conquest”:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>These people had over twenty years of abundance and health
      and multiplied greatly. All of the land looked like one town
      and they built many temples which can be seen to-day in all
      parts; and crossing the mountains, one can see through the
      leaves of the trees sides of houses and buildings wonderfully
      constructed. After all this happiness, one evening in the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
      winter a wind arose about six o’clock and increased until it
      became a hurricane of the Four Winds.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This wind tore out the
      large trees, made a great slaughter of all kinds of game, tore
      down all the high houses, which, as they were thatched with
      straw and had fire inside against the cold, caught fire. Great
      numbers of people were burned and those that escaped were torn
      to pieces by falling trees.</p>

    <p>This hurricane lasted until noon of the next day. Some who
      lived in small houses escaped—the young people who were just
      married, who were accustomed to build small houses in front of
      those of their parents or parents-in-law, where they lived the
      first years.</p>

    <p>Thus this land then lost its name, which was U-Lumil-Ceh,
      U-Lumil-Cutz, Land of the Deer, Land of the Wild Turkey, and
      was without trees. The trees now seen all appear to have been
      planted at the same time, as they are all of the same height,
      and, looking at this land from some spot, it seems as though it
      had been trimmed off with shears.</p>

    <p>Those who escaped felt encouraged to rebuild and cultivate the
      land and they again multiplied greatly, having fifteen years of
      health and good weather and the last year was the most fruitful
      of all. At the time of harvest, there came upon the land some
      contagious fevers which lasted twenty-four hours. After the
      fever the victim would swell up and burst open, being full of
      worms, and of this pestilence many people died leaving the
      fruit ungathered.</p>

    <p>After this pestilence there was another sixteen good years
      in which they renewed their passions and ravagings. In this
      way one hundred and fifty thousand men died in battle. After
      this massacre they were more calm and made peace and rested
      for twenty years. Then came another pestilence. Large pimples
      formed and they rotted the body and emitted offensive odors in
      a way that the members fell off by pieces within four or five
      days.</p>

    <p>This plague has passed more than fifty years ago, the massacres
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
      of the wars twenty years before that; the pestilence of the
      swelling and worms sixteen years before the wars; and the
      hurricane another sixteen years before that and twenty-two
      years after the destruction of Mayapan, which, according to
      this record, makes one hundred twenty-five years since the
      destruction. Thus by the wars and other punishments which
      God sent, it is a wonder there are as many people as are now
      living, although there are not many.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This quaint account by Landa sheds some light upon the condition of the
    Mayas during the century preceding the Spanish invasion and indicates
    that the golden age of the race had occurred not many centuries before.</p>

  <p>The legendary history of the coming of the Mayas to Chi-chen Itza is
    alluded to by Landa in several passages. He states:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It is the opinion among the Indians that with the Itzas who
      populated Chi-chen Itza, there reigned a great man called Kukul
      Can, and the principal temple of the city is called Kukul Can.
      They say he entered from the west, that he was very genteel,
      and that he had neither wife nor children. After he left
      Chi-chen Itza he was considered in Mexico one of their gods and
      called Quetzal Coatl and in Yucatan they also had him for a god.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In another place Landa says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The ancient Indians say that in Chi-chen Itza reigned three
      brothers. This was told to them by their ancestors. The three
      brothers came from the west and they reigned for some years in
      peace and justice. They honored their god very much and thus
      built many buildings and beautiful, especially one. These men,
      they say, lived without wives and in great honesty and virtue,
      and during this time they were much esteemed and obeyed by
      all. After a time one of them failed, who had to die, although
      some of the Indians said he went to Bak-halal. The absence of
      this one, no matter how he went, was felt so much by those who
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
      reigned after him that they began to be licentious and formed
      habits dishonorable and ungovernable, and the people began to
      hate them in such a way that they killed them, one after the
      other, and destroyed and abandoned the city.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Virtually the same stories are contained in a document found at
    Valladolid and dated 1618, which goes on to state that the newer part
    of Chi-chen Itza was built about 1200 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

  <p>The ancient city consists of two parts, the southern, which is ruined
    to such as extent that it contains almost no standing edifices, and the
    newer city built to the north, which contains many buildings—some of
    them almost perfectly preserved. I believe that much of the older city
    was built at least a thousand years prior to most of the buildings in
    the newer city, and there is ample evidence to substantiate the belief
    that the old city was ruthlessly robbed of its carvings and cut stones
    for use in the construction of the new.</p>

  <p>The Nahuatl influence is seen in the newer buildings. It is thought
    that Chi-chen Itza reached the height of its civil power, though not
    its artistic supremacy, after it had been conquered by the Aztec
    warriors from the north, and the native inhabitants were reduced to
    slavery and driven by their masters to the speedy building of many
    temples—an undertaking which they would have gone about in much more
    leisurely fashion had there been no compulsion.</p>

  <p>Don Pedro Aguilar, one of the earliest historians of Yucatan, states
    that six hundred years before the coming of the Spaniards the Mayas
    were the vassals of the Aztecs and were forced by them to construct
    remarkable edifices such as those found at Chi-chen Itza and Uxmal.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

  <p>Herbert Spinden, in his admirable little book “Ancient Civilizations of
    Mexico,” has most happily drawn an analogy between the traits of the
    Mayas and Aztecs and the similar traits of the old Greeks and Romans.
    The Mayas were like the Greeks, the creative race, while the Aztecs
    were primarily warriors, as were the Romans.</p>

  <p>Just what was the impulse which led these people to undertake the
    mighty works they accomplished,—whether it was religious fervor or
    plain fear,—we do not know. We do know that their age of greatest
    progress was within the era of verifiable history. We know that they
    built many large cities; and that there was a large population;
    Chi-chen Itza was a city of at least two hundred thousand inhabitants,
    and some archæologists believe that at one time its population numbered
    no less than a million.</p>

  <p>During their supreme period they built great pyramids and marvelous
    temples. They wrote books and set up intricately carved record-stones.
    They brought the whole of Yucatan into a federation of government that
    held the people together in a unity which has few parallels in the
    history of the human race. They evolved a calendar which is ingenious,
    complicated, and amazingly correct. They read the heavens and knew the
    planets and their seasons and changes. They displayed in all they did a
    genius to invent and an ability to execute which cause us to rate their
    culture very high; and this culture is all the more wonderful because
    it was purely original and cut off by an ocean on each side from any
    contact with the rest of the world.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
      <span class="small">DON EDUARDO’S FIRST VIEW OF THE CITY OF THE SACRED WELL</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">DON EDUARDO has described to me his first trip to Chi-chen Itza, and
    his impressions, which are somewhat as follows if my notes and memory
    do not err:</p>

  <p>“I had traveled all of a hot and dusty day, on horseback, through the
    jungle and over animal trails. In many places my Indian guide, who went
    afoot, had to lead my horse over or around the huge stones that blocked
    our path. After the first few miles I was painfully aware that running
    blithely from my city into Mérida, for forgotten trifles or even for
    sorely needed supplies, was another of my pleasant fancies thoroughly
    punctured.</p>

  <p>“Darkness overtook us ere we reached our journey’s end, and the ensuing
    coolness was delightfully refreshing even though the dark slowed our
    already snail-like progress. Just when I had abandoned all hope of
    making further headway, the moon sailed majestically into view—a
    gorgeous full moon in a perfect Yucatan night, lighting every object
    softly, gently, with a caressing touch so lacking in the masculine
    directness of Old Sol. A more lovely silver and black-velvet night
    I have never seen. Truly, the moon magic of Yucatan is no less than
    divine stage-craft which subtly wafts one completely away from the Land
    of Things as They Are and into the Realm of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> Enchantment. I should
    not have been surprised to meet the March Hare, Lancelot, Gulliver,
    Scheherezade, or Helen of Troy. In fact, I was prepared to stop and
    chat with any of them and offer a bite from the one remaining cake of
    chocolate in my pocket.</p>

  <p>“Sometime, and most reluctantly, I suppose I must go the way of all
    flesh. If so, then by all means let it be in the full glory of a
    Yucatan moon and the going will not be unpleasant.</p>

  <p>“For days I had been traveling, first by train, then by <i lang="myn">volan</i>,—that
    satanic contrivance which leaves one bruised and bumped from head
    to foot,—and finally in the saddle, dozing over the head of a
    somnambulant horse.</p>

  <p>“Even the witchery of the moonlight could not long hold alert my
    fatigued body and mind. On and on we plodded, hour after hour.
    Midnight passed and how many more hours I do not know, when I heard
    an exclamation in the vernacular, from my guide. Startled out of a
    half-conscious dream I came erect in the saddle.</p>

  <p>“My Indian was earnestly pointing up and ahead. I raised my eyes and
    became electrically, tinglingly awake. There, high up, wraith-like in
    the waning moonlight, loomed what seemed a Grecian temple of colossal
    proportions, atop a great steep hill. So massive did it seem in the
    half-light of the approaching morning that I could think of it only as
    an impregnable fortress high above the sea, on some rocky, wave-dashed
    promontory. As this mass took clearer shape before me with each
    succeeding hoof-beat of my weary steed, it grew more and more huge. I
    felt an actual physical pain, as if my heart skipped a few beats and
    then raced to make up the loss.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

  <p>“Thus for the first time I viewed the Great Pyramid of Kukul Can, now
    called El Castillo—the Castle. And I shall always be glad that I
    had the good fortune to get my first glimpse of it in this fashion.
    Times without number I have since passed and repassed this grand old
    structure, yet never have I walked in its shadow without a quickening
    of the pulse or without recalling undimmed the vision of that moonlit
    night. And, as I look back through my years of intimate companionship
    with my City of the Sacred Well, it seems to me that moonlit nights
    are linked inextricably with nearly all the important events that have
    there befallen me—or, at least, with those which are pleasant in
    retrospect.</p>

  <p>“By the time I had dismounted and unsaddled my horse my Indian was
    already curled up and fast asleep. The poor horse was, I think, in
    sound slumber the minute his feet came to a halt. But for me, weary as
    I was, sleep was out of the question. I must see more of this magic
    city. Reaching the foot of the steep ascent, I crawled painfully up
    what had obviously once been a tremendous stairway, now overgrown with
    small trees and shrubs. At the end of a breathless climb I reached a
    narrow, level stone ledge eighty feet above the ground and faced the
    north door of the temple—the temple of the great god Kukul Can. This
    sheer pile of perfectly joined masonry pierced by a forty-foot doorway
    within whose sides I could dimly discern intricate and fantastically
    carved bas-reliefs; this time-grayed temple of a forgotten faith,
    viewed there in the silence and solitude of eerie moonlight—is it
    to be wondered at if my knees shook just a little and if I glanced
    apprehensively over my shoulder awaiting the terrible, majestic wrath
    of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> god whose temple was profaned by the eyes of an unbeliever?</p>

  <p>“On my eminence I turned slowly and gazed out over the dead city. Here
    and there, some near by and some at a distance, were a dozen other
    pyramids surmounted by buildings. A few seemed well preserved, others
    were in picturesque ruins, all ghostly white in the moonlight, except
    where a doorway or a shadow stood out in inky blackness. I could see
    the long shadow of that old temple we call the ‘Nunnery.’ The stillness
    was broken only by the monotonous hum of hidden cicadas; or was it the
    distant beat of phantom <i lang="myn">tunkuls</i>, or sacred drums, warning that the
    ancient God of the Feathered Serpent did but sleep and might at any
    moment awake?</p>

  <p>“And then my eyes were caught and held by a broad raised roadway
    leading straight away from the temple toward a vast black pool
    overgrown with trees. Breathless, frozen to the spot, I could only look
    and look, for in a blinding flash I realized that I was gazing at the
    Sacred Way, and at its end the Sacred Well in whose murky depths even
    then might lie the pitiful bones of many once lovely maidens sacrificed
    to appease a grim god. What untold treasures this grisly well might
    hide! What tragedies had been enacted at its brink!</p>

  <p>“I descended and as I walked along the Sacred Way I thought of the
    thousands, millions perhaps, of times this worn thoroughfare had been
    trodden in bygone ages where all was now desolate. Here was I, a grain
    of dust moving where kings and nobles of countless centuries before had
    trod, and where, for all I know, kings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> nobles may again tread long
    years after I am still a grain of dust but moveless.</p>

  <p>“At the brink of the well I peered into the blackness and continued to
    gaze into its depths, picturing in my mind’s eye the awesome ceremonies
    it had witnessed. The chant of death begins, swelling softly over the
    slow pulsing of the drums. The solemn procession leaves the holy temple
    of Kukul Can and the funeral cortège advances along the broad raised
    avenue of the Sacred Way, toward the Sacred Well, the dwelling-place of
    Noh-och Yum Chac, the terrible Rain God who must be placated by human
    sacrifice. The corn in the fields is withering, crying for rain. If
    the anger of Yum Chac be not appeased famine will follow and the dread
    Lord of Death, Ah Puch—he of the grinning, sightless skull—will walk
    abroad in the land.</p>

  <p>“Slowly, slowly the cortège draws near. At its head is the high priest,
    clad in ceremonial vestments and elaborate feathered head-dress,
    as befits the pontiff of the Feathered Serpent. And what is this
    embroidered bower borne so reverently by sturdy, sun-browned lesser
    priests? Is it a bier, a stately catafalque? Is the pitiful victim
    already dead? Ah, no! she moves, beautiful, flawless—the most lovely
    maiden to be found in the land. Through every city and village and
    country-side, for weeks and weeks, a thousand priests have sought her,
    this fairest flower of Maya maidenhood. Her face is pale. She knows the
    supreme honor that is hers—she who is to become so soon the bride of
    the Rain God. But there is terror in those lovely eyes, a benumbing,
    cold fear of the Unknown.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

  <p>“And behind them, filling the whole of the Sacred Way, come the king,
    the nobles, the great warriors and many priests. Already on the far
    side of the Sacred Well is gathered a silent, grave-faced multitude,
    the whole populace of the city and pilgrims from afar.</p>

  <p>“The high priest enters the little temple at the brink of the well. The
    dirge ceases, the drums are stilled. He performs his devotions to the
    Rain God. He lights the sacred incense-burners and the fragrant blue
    vapor floats, curling, upward. Again the slowly chanted dirge starts,
    to the muted beating of the drums. He lights a basket of sweet-smelling
    copal incense, holds it aloft, and casts it into the well. The chant
    grows louder, the drums beat faster.</p>

  <p>“Two powerful <i lang="myn">nacons</i>, or lesser priests, lift the maiden from her
    couch, their muscular brown arms forming a sling in which she lies as
    lightly as a leaf on the bosom of a stream. They advance with her to
    the edge of the well. The pitiless sun glares down into her upturned
    fear-stricken eyes and she throws one slender arm over her face. Her
    gauzy garments reveal the tender flesh and adolescent contours of a
    girl in her early teens.</p>

  <p>“Slowly the <i lang="myn">nacons</i> swing the feather-light body backward and forward
    to the beat of the drums and the rhythm of the dirge; forward and
    backward in an ever wider sweep, while the drums and chant swell to a
    roar. At a sign from the high priest the drums are suddenly stilled;
    the chant ends in a high-pitched wail. A last forward swing and the
    bride of Yum Chac hurtles far out over the well. Turning slowly in the
    air, the lithesome body falls faster and faster till it strikes the
    dark water seventy feet below.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

  <p>“An echoing splash and all is still. Only the widening ripples are
    left. The child bride has found favor in the eyes of her lord, the
    great god Noh-och Yum Chac.</p>

  <p>“Thus I imagined the sacrifice at the Sacred Well—a sacrifice enacted
    not once but hundreds of times through many centuries. Thus has it been
    handed down in a dozen Maya legends and I wondered whether this grim
    old well really held at its far murky bottom the relics of the ancient
    rites or, after all, the sacrifices were mere myths founded on some
    trivial event, which grew and grew with each telling.</p>

  <p>“Granting that such sacrifices had been, every vestige of evidence
    might well have disintegrated into nothingness a thousand years before
    my time. Assuming even that at the bottom of this watery pit was
    all I sought, what a mad venture it was for one lone man with but a
    little money and no great mechanical skill to attempt to recover these
    evidences!</p>

  <p>“And yet my faith was strong. I felt that my quest was not to be in
    vain and that somehow I would make the well yield up its treasures. At
    least I must attempt the feat or continue to be haunted by the idea all
    the rest of my life.</p>

  <p>“My wearied brain could no longer sustain these speculations. My whole
    tired body knew but one desire—sleep. Yet I did not wish to sleep in
    this gruesome place. Half a mile farther on I should find the Casa
    Real, the old manor-house that was to be my home. Wearily I strove
    toward it in the failing moonlight.</p>

  <p>“At last I approached the main arched gateway of the corral, built
    more than two hundred years ago. It was boldly outlined in the pale
    moonlight, while here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> and there were long jet shadows cast by some
    broken portion of a wall or by some partially burned but upright trunk
    of a great tree. All was desolation, as in the case of the ancient
    temples, but a newer desolation, for this manor had been built less
    than seventy years before. As I pushed my way over broken stones a
    cloud came over the moon and I stumbled full upon what seemed at first
    the vertebræ of a huge fish. The cloud passed as I halted and an
    involuntary shudder gripped me as I looked down on the whitened bones
    of a human skeleton. A little to one side on a slight elevation lay the
    severed skull; and just beyond was still another and yet another. Ah,
    yes! I knew the tragic story, but had not expected to be met with so
    brutal a reminder of it.</p>

  <p>“The former inhabitants of this once beautiful hacienda had all been
    massacred, many years before, by the Sublevados, the untamed tribes of
    Maya Indians living some miles to the south. These savages had slain
    every living creature on the estate and had left the several buildings
    in smoldering ruins. Even at the present time the Sublevados are still
    untamed and I have often been warned of the menace of a similar fate.</p>

  <p>“I turned and gazed at the old gateway under which I had so recently
    passed—a gateway, so the records say, built in June, 1721. Under it
    also had passed long lines of weeping captives, and there are men
    living who remember the event. These poor captives were laden with the
    booty taken from the villages of Tunkas and Dzitas as they were urged
    on by their Sublevado captors in their terrible journey to Chan Santa
    Cruz, the distant Sublevado stronghold. And only the vigorous men with
    trades and the young women were spared for the journey, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> the
    other prisoners were ruthlessly murdered. Of the prisoners left alive
    for the journey those who fell by the wayside were despatched with a
    stroke of the machete and left where they fell. I later found many of
    their pitiful skeletons.</p>

  <p>“Poor boys and girls! What heart-pangs they must have felt; what
    scalding tears must have fallen on the stone flags as they passed
    beneath this old arch! Their pangs were soon stilled and the tears
    they spilled quickly dried, for they all soon came to that tranquil
    rest which is for eternity. Their lives were like the meteor that
    flashes for a moment in the sky and is then forever snuffed out. ‘Cigar
    stubs that the God of Night tosses away’ is the native vernacular for
    meteors. The souls of these wretched youths and maidens seem to have
    been no less carelessly tossed away by the God of the Night.</p>

  <p>“I sank down upon the corridor of my new-old home, too utterly fatigued
    in mind and body to care what army of horrid phantoms might there
    abide. Let graveyards yawn and specters dance, let witches ride; loose
    Beelzebub and all his imps, but let me sleep!</p>

  <p>“And so I did until awakened by a torrid sun burning down upon me
    through what once had been a roof.”</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER V<br />
      <span class="small">THE ANCIENT CITY</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">“I AROSE cautiously, expecting to find an ache in every bone and
    muscle, and was agreeably surprised to discover myself without an ache
    or a pain, though a little stiff. Apparently the hot sun had baked
    all pains away. In a shady place near by sat my Indian, not sleeping,
    apparently not even thinking, but just doing nothing at all, an art in
    which he was an adept.</p>

  <p>“I was conscious of an earnest desire for two things,—a bath and
    breakfast,—and I wanted a great deal of both. Without much difficulty,
    in sign language, I made my wishes clear to the native and he conducted
    me a distance of half a mile or so, not to the Sacred Well but to
    another well or cenote called Tol-oc, which is about two hundred feet
    to the left of the road leading to the village of Pisté. How he knew so
    definitely the location of the well is a mystery to me.</p>

  <p>“This great cool, crystal-clear pool was the water-supply of the
    ancient city. A wide flight of steps, now much broken, leads into
    its depths and the lower steps are at present actually some distance
    beneath the surface of the water. On the stone rim of the sides of the
    pool are deep grooves, worn in olden times by the ceaseless raising and
    lowering of rope-suspended water-jugs or gourds. And can’t you picture
    the women of old Chi-chen Itza in a constant stream passing from dawn
    till dusk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> along the road to the well of Tol-oc?—the servant glad
    to escape for a time the sharp tongue of her mistress; the wrinkled,
    toothless crone to whom a trip to the well means an opportunity to
    exchange the latest gossip; the comely young matron anxious to get back
    to her household tasks; the belle of the neighborhood, on her way to
    the well, light-heartedly swinging her empty water-jug and bantering
    those who pass. This is a phase of life as old as communal existence.
    One may see the same scene enacted to-day almost anywhere south of the
    Rio Grande or in Spain, Egypt, or the Orient.</p>

  <p>“As I swam about in the pool fresh vigor flowed into my veins, and I
    emerged with an increased craving for breakfast. When I reached the
    hacienda I found my Indian had anticipated this and while the repast
    he provided might not have appealed to a pampered appetite, I found it
    a Lucullian feast; and my guide proved no mean trencherman, either,
    although I suspect he had fortified himself with no less heartening a
    meal two hours earlier, when he found me asleep.</p>

  <p>“While he performed the housewifely task of doing the dishes, which
    consisted of throwing away the big green leaves we used as plates, I
    sat in the shade of a magnificent old <i lang="myn">yax-che</i>—the sacred tree of
    the Mayas—and puffed my favorite and most disreputable pipe. Sitting
    somewhere in the shade around Chi-chen Itza is the most pleasant
    occupation in the universe, for there is a perpetual breeze and no
    matter how hot the sun, one is always cool and comfortable in the
    shade. Sitting thus is the favorite and major occupation of the native,
    and the white man can very easily acquire the habit.</p>

  <p>“As I sat there, at peace with the world, my experiences <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>of the
    previous night seemed unreal—the fantasmagoria of a fevered dream and,
    much as I enjoyed this shady spot where I sat, the ancient city called
    me.</p>

  <p>“Taking the Indian with me, I returned to make a superficial
    examination of the place. My newly acquired estate of about thirty-six
    square miles included the abandoned, dilapidated manor, corrals, and
    other buildings. And within its boundaries lie the Sacred Well and
    all of the ancient ruins and temples that are still standing, not to
    mention many others which are now covered with debris. It also includes
    several Indian villages. Chi-chen Itza is really two cities. The more
    ancient is overgrown by a thick forest and its location is indicated
    only by an occasional grassy, thicket-covered mound out of which grow
    great trees and whose sides are covered with scattered carved stones.
    The newer city is clearly defined by the buildings which are still
    standing. The whole, including the older and the newer city, covers an
    area of about twelve square miles.</p>

  <p>“There is no apparent plan in the situation of the various structures,
    although most of them are arranged in such a way that their openings
    avoid the direct rays of the sun at midday. The city was built in this
    location because of the two great wells and the lesser one, which I
    am sure are not the work of men, although they may have been altered
    or enlarged. In all probability there were no definite and continuous
    streets; with the exception of the Via Sacra or Sacred Way, there is
    little or no evidence of what might be called a city street.</p>

  <p>“I reason that there was little need for streets, because there were no
    beasts of burden, nor vehicular traffic. Loads were transported upon
    the backs of men, just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> they are largely transported at the present
    time. The ancient builders did construct very good narrow, ballasted
    stone roads which led into Chi-chen Itza from various directions, but
    they were roads for human feet to travel. Surely the architects of
    these wonderful buildings; these people who knew much of astronomy and
    who could count into prodigious figures had the intelligence to lay
    out their cities in blocks and squares if any particular advantage or
    convenience were to be gained thereby!</p>

  <p>“The only evident plan is that the present buildings, which are temples
    and perhaps palaces for the kings and those of high religious or noble
    rank, are centrally located. Beyond these for miles about are the
    remains of small rectangular foundations, evidently the sites of what
    were once the dwelling-places of the large population of the city.</p>

  <p>“In the area which I designate as new Chi-chen Itza are twelve
    buildings in an almost perfect state of preservation, as though built
    no more than twenty or thirty years ago. Ten of them are still covered
    with their original ponderous stone roofs and are entirely habitable.
    These structures alone might house a considerable population. I have
    lived for months at a time in one or another of them and have found
    them to be delightfully comfortable and cool. Indeed, these elevated
    Maya temples are the most ideal living-quarters, much to be preferred
    to the usual house built upon level ground. Although they contain no
    windows, they are well lighted by the reflected sunlight striking
    through the doorways upon the white limestone floors.</p>

  <p>“Passing across what is now a lovely flower garden in the rear of my
    home,—which is no other than the building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> in whose broken corridor I
    spent my first night,—my guide and I came at no great distance upon
    a rise of ground where are situated two most interesting groups of
    buildings. The first one, a massive structure on our right, bears the
    curious name Akab Tzib, ‘House of the Writing in the Dark.’ It is one
    of the few buildings which has no sub-base or plinth of artificially
    heaped earth or stone to give it elevation. It is built upon the
    natural ground-level, which, however, is somewhat higher at this point
    than the surrounding terrain. And it stands sheer on the edge of a
    depression in the ground some four hundred feet across.</p>

  <p>“It is possible that this depression represents the site of an ancient
    quarry from which the stone for the building of the city was taken,
    or it may be simply a natural hollow caused by the caving in of the
    soft limestone surface rock. The front of Akab Tzib stretches a
    distance of one hundred and seventy-six feet and in depth the building
    is forty-eight feet. The structure is low, the façade rising only
    to a height of eighteen feet. The walls, however, are capable of
    withstanding a siege. They are of great thickness and constructed of
    perfectly joined rectangular stones, the surfaces of which are dressed
    and polished to smoothness. The expanse of the west wall is broken by
    a shallow recess in the center which divides the wall into three equal
    sections, with the middle section recessed or offset by a depth of
    about three feet.</p>

  <p>“This central part is pierced by three square-cut doorways. John L.
    Stephens, who visited the temple more than eighty years ago, says that
    in the middle section of the interior was a great stairway that led to
    the roof.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> It has since collapsed and is now but a heap of stones and
    dust. Apparently it was about forty-five feet wide. Knowing the Maya
    custom, which was common, of erecting one structure on top of another,
    we may surmise that this stairway was probably a sort of flying arch
    and intended as a means of reaching a second temple to be built on top
    of the low, massive-walled Akab Tzib. For some unknown reason the upper
    temple was never erected. Many interesting theories have been advanced
    as to why the architects abandoned their original plan. On each side
    of what was once the stairway are doors leading into chambers. Besides
    these entrances there are seven handsome doorways along the western
    façade of the building. In all, there are eighteen rooms or apartments.</p>

  <p>“The whole massive structure is an unsolved mystery. Over the doorway
    of a small, dim chamber in the southeastern part of the building is
    a carved lintel on which is depicted in bas-relief the seated figure
    of a priest or a god, wearing a feathered head-dress and with a long
    nose-plug protruding from the nostrils. The figure is seated on a
    throne and holds in its hand the ceremonial <i lang="myn">caluac</i> or baton of rank.
    In front of the figure, at its feet, is a graceful brazier containing
    what was probably a burnt offering of some sort—copal or incense. On
    each side of this well-carved picture are double rows of hieroglyphs,
    the meaning of which is unknown. There are no other carvings, glyphs,
    or pictures in the entire building. This fact is hard to understand,
    because these ancient builders usually inscribed every available
    surface. In one room is a large depression in the floor, and in the
    center of the building is what appears to be a solid mass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> of masonry
    forty-four by thirty feet and reaching clear to the ceiling. Perhaps it
    contains hidden and secret chambers; that remains to be found out.</p>

  <p>“Of one thing, however, I am reasonably sure: the carved lintel was
    not inscribed nor originally designed for its present position, but
    was taken bodily from some earlier structure, probably one of the now
    leveled temples of the older Chi-chen Itza. It represents the period
    of the highest Mayan art, which occurred before the domination of the
    Nahuatls, who swept down from the north some centuries later. I believe
    this building was not erected until after the abandonment of Chi-chen
    Itza, the long residence at Chan Kan Putun, the return to Chi-chen
    Itza, and the enslavement of the Mayas by the Nahuatls. Very likely it
    is the most recently built of all the present monuments in the city,
    and the one carved piece in it, the lintel, was taken from an older
    building without reference to the significance of the glyphs. From this
    lintel is derived the name of the temple, for Akab Tzib means literally
    ‘House of the Writing in the Dark.’</p>

  <p>“Leaving Akab Tzib, we walk for the distance of a city block or so
    through dense shrubbery and over an old stone fence, built perhaps
    eighty years ago, and come to a most interesting building called La
    Casa de las Monjas or the Nunnery. It is what might be called rambling,
    yet is of exquisite architectural harmony and richly ornamented, in
    utter contrast to the building we have just left. It is one of the
    most wonderfully carved edifices of this old civilization to be found
    anywhere in Yucatan. It spreads out for an eye-filling distance of two
    hundred and twenty-eight feet, the center part of the huge pile rising
    for nearly ninety feet, in three separate tiers, each <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>smaller than the
    one below it. Stretching away on each side of this center portion are
    one- and two-story annexes.</p>

  </div>

  <p>“How well its name fits this grimly beautiful old building is a matter
    of conjecture. We know that the Maya priesthood was dominant in all
    matters and that the lives of the people seem to have been governed by
    a constant devotion to their pantheon of gods and especially to the
    all-great Kukul Can. Their ceremonies were numerous and elaborate.
    Doubtless there were many priests and perhaps priestesses. Long
    training must have been required in the amazing and intricate rituals.
    And the ancient historians relate that it was the custom to sequester
    certain girls or women belonging to religious orders. It is not
    unlikely that this vast building of many rooms and annexes, which seems
    more fitted to be a place of residence than a temple, may have been
    the abode of Mayan monks or nuns, or possibly a training school for
    novitiates. Some believe it to have been the king’s palace.</p>

  <p>“Not the least perplexing thing about La Casa de las Monjas is the plain
    evidence that what now meets our eyes as a symmetrical whole is,
    in fact, the result of several different periods of building. The
    principal structure has been built in stages—for all the world as a
    swallow year after year builds one nest on top of the previous one.
    And the annexes evidently were built at various times, as the need for
    them arose. The whole base of the building is buried in debris, which
    detracts from the true and lovely lines of the architecture. I have
    excavated a trench part-way around, to clear out this rubbish, and
    the trench reveals the fact that La Casa de las Monjas has served as a
    dwelling-place for many people, or that many lived near by even long
    after the place had lost its sacred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> significance and its very name and
    purpose were no longer known.</p>

  <p>“Without danger of contradiction, I think we may in fancy reconstruct
    this Nunnery, in the order of its building. The first structure was
    a single, rectangular unit about one hundred feet in length. A later
    builder caused it to be entirely filled with great stones and rubble
    and cement, so that it formed a solid base or foundation. More masonry
    was then erected to the same height, on three sides, to enlarge this
    base area, and upon the whole was erected a building ninety feet long
    and one third as wide, leaving a flat promenade twenty-five feet wide
    all around, from which there is a delightful view of the surrounding
    country. We have dug through the masonry of the sub-structures and
    into the old, original building which was filled in with stone-work
    to provide a support for the later and upper buildings, so that our
    theories are substantiated that far at least.</p>

  <p>“To reach the second structure, whose floor is thirty-four feet
    above-ground, a great stone stairway of forty steps was erected, up
    which twenty men might march abreast. If they were men of our day they
    must surely come tumbling down again, for the steps are each nine
    inches high but with very narrow treads, built for bare-footed or
    sandaled folk and not for clodhopper boots or shoes.</p>

  <p>“A third and still smaller structure—now little more than a jumble
    of stones, except for a part of one façade and a doorway—was built
    atop the second temple and served by another grand and steep stairway,
    a continuation of the first. This topmost temple was rich in carved
    stones, taken, in all probability, from the oft-ravaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> older city.
    The various annexes were built on to or adjacent to the first and
    largest building. All this the reader will see from the illustrations
    opposite <a href="#i_065a">page 65</a> and page 69 [missing]. The custom of enlarging Maya temples by
    such methods as just described was not uncommon. Perhaps it indicated
    growing power or population. Surely it indicated long residence.</p>

  <p>“The main building, constituting the second story, has five doorways on
    the south side and one doorway at each end, and contains many chambers
    and intercommunicating doorways. The end rooms extend clear across
    the building. The central rooms are long and narrow, each with three
    doorways. There are also very many shallow alcoves, scarcely more than
    niches, which may have contained idols or scrolls—some say books. The
    center portion is solid masonry, which originally may have contained
    apartments later filled with stone to provide support for the third
    story.</p>

  <p>“The entire rambling structure is ornamented with symbolistic carvings
    and murals in a profusion of designs, many of them of matchless
    beauty in inspiration and execution. The façade of the main building
    is twenty-five feet in height, with two handsome stone cornices
    extending its whole length. The eastern façade in particular is crowded
    with ornamentation. The dominant motif is the face of the god Kukul
    Can—symbolic masks with upturned snouts which some observers have
    called ‘elephant trunks.’ The same masks are seen again and again in
    all these old ruins, but in many cases the projecting snouts have been
    broken off by vandals; indeed, a special zeal has at some time been
    devoted to this particular destruction. Linking the masks and carrying
    the whole in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> carefully planned and balanced decorative series are
    geometrical designs and figures. Above the broad band of the upper
    cornice and carved in deep relief are geometrical stone screens not
    inferior to those of the Moors or of India.</p>

  <p>“Over the main doorway are two bands of small, undeciphered
    hieroglyphs, above which project six bold and gracefully curved
    ornaments. From them, we may imagine, once hung a costly curtain, heavy
    with embroidery. And still higher above the doorway, interrupting the
    geometrical sculptures of the whole façade, is a horseshoe-shaped
    frame within which may still be seen a badly defaced seated figure
    with feathered head-dress. The lintels over the classic doorways are
    of huge perfectly cut and polished stones, each bearing a multiplicity
    of clear-cut glyphs which, like many things in this City of the Sacred
    Well, tenaciously hold their secrets.</p>

  <p>“The Nunnery stands a monument of grace and beauty whose charm is
    at once evident to any beholder, and doubly so to him who perceives
    how closely in every line and dimension, yet how subtly, it accords
    with our modern ideas and rules of good design. But nowhere else
    in the world is there anything like it. Unique, distinctive, it is
    characteristic only of this ancient culture. The cut facing <a href="#i_065a">page 65</a>,
    representing one of the best of my many photographic attempts, tells
    all that a photograph can, but it cannot begin to convey the beauty
    of this masterpiece. In the great main hall were once many colorful
    paintings upon the walls and ceilings, still indicated by bits of color
    here and there or by an interrupted broad band of black or red. And in
    the various rooms were paintings, nearly all now obliterated. They seem
    to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> reached quite lately their critical age, for many that were
    almost perfect as recently as twenty years ago are faded or chipped
    now. In a few years they will be gone forever, and for this reason I
    have taken pains to obtain the most faithful possible copies of all of
    them. These Maya paintings represent several periods of culture. Some
    are childishly crude. Many are of an excellence of line and balance
    and color not inferior to the best of modern art. Some even are drawn
    in a most pleasingly free and sketchy manner which so exquisitely
    portrays an idea without unnecessary detail that one almost expects
    to see scrawled in the lower right hand corner the signature of some
    well-known modern artist.</p>

  <p>“The eastern or ground-level portion of the added basic structure
    contains many rooms entered by way of six wide outer doorways.</p>

  <p>“Near the main building are two smaller detached ones, the more
    interesting being known as the Iglesia or Church. It is small in
    comparison with the bulk of La Casa de las Monjas, being but twenty-six
    feet long, half as wide, and thirty-two feet high. It has three
    cornices and the principal decoration consists of two seated human
    figures over the doorway. Hardly a square inch of its surface is
    undecorated. Formerly it was stuccoed, or plastered, and painted. Much
    of the original color still clings to the crevices and interstices of
    its carved walls and it is evident that new layers of stucco were added
    from time to time and new paint in appropriate colors. Such layers of
    stucco and color may be seen where the stone has been chipped, with the
    colors sometimes varying from those of the early coats.</p>

  <p>“The carvings again portray the mask of Kukul Can,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> with interlinking
    geometrical designs. A single doorway gives access to the interior,
    once rich in murals, and the bright sunshine striking upon the white
    floor floods the whole room with clear light. Close to the ceiling are
    traces of a row of medallions which originally contained hieroglyphs.</p>

  <p>“Another building of about the same size is similarly finished and
    decorated with the mask of Kukul Can. It contains several small rooms.
    The entire wall of one apartment has been removed, by not very ancient
    builders, for the prosaic purpose of making a stone fence. In passing
    I might mention also that a good-sized pit has been made near one side
    of the grand stairway of La Casa de las Monjas, it being easier to get cut
    stone in this way than to quarry it.</p>

  <p>“No great amount of labor would be required to put this group of
    buildings in nearly its pristine condition. Nearly all the stones that
    have fallen lie where they fell and could easily be replaced. Near
    the grand stairway lie many sculptured images of serpents, birds, and
    animals, of massive size and carved in full relief. These formed the
    balustrade and might be replaced even though some are missing. I have
    no doubt that when the debris at the base of the buildings is removed
    new archæological treasures will be revealed.</p>

  <p>“As an interesting bit of authentic history, the main building was
    occupied by the soldiers of Montejo, who were besieged there by the
    enraged native populace. They escaped by night, through the rear of the
    buildings, by means of a ruse. The besiegers did not discover until
    dawn that the enemy had fled many hours before.</p>

  <p>“Just when one decides that there is nothing new to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> surprise him,
    in this old city, he comes upon something else to puzzle his brain,
    spurring his curiosity into vain excursions after the why and wherefore
    of it all.</p>

  <p>“We leave the unexplainable Casa de las Monjas and, walking westward less
    than a hundred yards, stand before the Caracol or Snail-shell, which
    is entirely unlike any other building in the City of the Sacred Well
    or in all of Yucatan. This curious structure, we imagine, was either a
    watch-tower or an astronomical observatory—though it may have served a
    quite different purpose. It is round and built on a terrace two hundred
    feet square of cut stone, twenty feet in height. Above this is a second
    stone terrace, twelve feet high. These terraces have sheer vertical
    sides, but much fallen stone and debris have gathered about them. From
    the west a stairway forty-five feet wide leads to the first terrace; it
    was once bordered with great stone balusters in the form of tremendous
    entwined serpents, their heads on the ground, their bodies forming the
    balustrade and ending at the top in rattles. The same sort of device is
    found again and again in Maya architecture. A second similar stairway
    leads to the upper terrace and the door of the building. A projecting
    ornamented cornice caps each terrace.</p>

  <p>“At the top of the second stairway was once some large object which
    Stephens thought was an idol, and here was uncovered a hieroglyphed
    monument bearing the longest inscription yet found in the city. The
    round tower is forty feet in diameter and forty feet high, with two
    concentric walls, each two and a half feet thick. The inner wall
    incloses a circular chamber at the center of which is a core of small
    diameter, solid except for a winding stairway at its center, extending
    from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> ground-level to the height of the double walls. There is
    also a passage, now almost obliterated, piercing the lower terrace and
    connecting with this winding stairway. The building at the top of the
    double walls has a deep-jutting five-tiered cornice above which rises
    another and smaller single-walled tower, surrounded by a promenade or
    ledge, not unlike the balcony of a lighthouse, at the height of the
    cornice.</p>

  <p>“The space between the outer and the inner wall provides an arched
    chamber five feet wide and one hundred feet in circumference. The inner
    chamber also is arched and is eight feet wide. The usual Maya arch
    construction is employed, the arch beginning at a height of ten feet
    and being about twenty-four feet at the peak. The upper ruined tower,
    about twenty feet high, contained a stone-lined passage facing due
    west which might have been used as a line of sight for astronomical
    observations.</p>

  <p>“The outer walls are pierced by four openings—windows or doorways,
    whichever they may have been—corresponding to the four points of the
    compass. Similar openings occur in the inner wall but, curiously, they
    are exactly forty-five degrees out of line with the openings in the
    outer wall. One of the most novel features in the construction are
    the many wooden beams placed horizontally between the inner and outer
    shells of masonry. As these are set in the masonry, it is evident that
    they are an original and integral part of the building, probably put
    there to help support the stone-work during construction. Many have
    stood the test of time and are still stanch and firm. They are hewn
    from the famous sapote tree, whose wood of steel-like hardness alone
    could have endured through the centuries. There is no ornamentation
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>within the building, nor upon its walls, and the construction is pure
    Maya except that it is round where all else is square.</p>

  <p>“The curious edifice is on high ground and its construction leads
    inevitably to the idea of a watch-tower. Its builders knew in their
    time quite as much about astronomy as did any contemporary race—if
    not more. The periods of sun, moon, and planets they knew with great
    accuracy. For these reasons I like to think that their priests and
    sages came to this tower, making divinations from the stars and
    laboriously charting their positions and courses. Possibly they were
    panic-stricken by an occasional eclipse of moon or sun, which they
    called <i lang="myn">chi-bal-kin</i>, ‘the moon or sun devoured by serpents or other
    beings.’</p>

  <p>“But perhaps this tower was no more than a military precaution, a
    place where solitary watchers by day and night constantly scanned
    the horizon. Maybe it was merely the local police station or fire
    department from which could be seen any undue disturbance or the
    outbreak of a conflagration. I shall leave it to you to make your own
    conclusions, which may be quite as near to or as far from the actual
    fact as my own, over which I have puzzled backward and forward for many
    years.</p>

  <p>“To the north a distance of four hundred feet is the so-called Red
    House, or Chich-an Chob, the latter name meaning ‘strong, clean house.’
    The name Red House is derived from the fact that the antechamber or
    vestibule across the front of the building has a broad painted band of
    red running about its four walls. This is the best-preserved building
    of all my city; scarcely a stone is missing. Its four walls face
    exactly the four points of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> compass; its main entrance is in the
    western wall, while the eastern wall is unbroken. It now rises from a
    lovely grassy terrace, slightly sloping from the vertical and about
    twelve feet high by sixty feet long, faced with large stone blocks
    and having rounded corner stones at each of the four sloping edges
    of the pyramidal form. Extending around the top of the terrace is a
    regular Maya cornice, or projecting coping. Approaching the western
    entrance is a stone stairway, twenty feet wide, of sixteen high and
    shallow cut-stone steps—a staircase as distinctly Mayan as the mask
    of Kukul Can. And this stairway is as perfect to-day as the day it was
    finished, not a stone out of place or broken. It seems incredible that
    it could have lain there so many centuries at the mercy of the tropical
    wilderness and of passing vandals and have suffered not at all.</p>

  <p>“Chich-an Chob deceives one at first glance, seeming to rise to a
    stately height because of its twenty-eight foot façade. The roof,
    however, is but twenty feet above the floor. The false front is
    nevertheless very lovely, being made of stone latticework which
    skilfully weaves with geometrical designs the ever-present elongated
    masks of the great Kukul Can, with the upturned snouts unbroken.
    The construction throughout is pure Mayan of the highest period,
    typical of many buildings seen in the southern part of Yucatan and
    particularly at Palenque. Three square-cut, high doorways give access
    to a shallow vestibule running the length of the building. Back of
    this is a wall with three more doorways, each opening into a separate
    chamber. A frieze of hieroglyphs cut in the stones somewhat above the
    doors completely encircles the walls of the vestibule. All of the
    interior walls are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> plastered and painted and have been replastered and
    repainted many times. The outer walls up to the stone latticework are
    quite plain, the cornices or moldings are unadorned, and except for the
    absence of pillars it could pass for a gem of Doric architecture. Its
    very simplicity is a pleasing contrast to the Nunnery; yet it is no
    less distinctly Mayan.</p>

  <p>“Two hundred feet beyond Chich-an Chob is a level terrace, or pyramid,
    sixty-four feet square, which supports a small three-chambered temple
    with an entrance to the south. One end has fallen in, but two of the
    chambers are in good repair. This temple, so far as I know, is nameless
    and at present is of no special interest. Clustered near by, to the
    right, are several smaller pyramids whose buildings are merely heaped
    ruins. Some of these contain tombs. Probably all were burial-places of
    great men. The principal pyramid of this group contains the tomb of the
    high priest and it is the scene of one of my most thrilling adventures.”</p>

  <p>The story of the exploration of the high priest’s tomb, alluded to by
    Don Eduardo, is very interesting and will be related in another chapter.</p>

  <p>In about the center of the City of the Sacred Well is El Castillo,
    whose imposing bulk is by far the greatest of all of the silent old
    structures of this ancient metropolis. Don Eduardo has told us that
    this huge pile struck him speechless when he came upon it suddenly in
    the moonlight upon his first introduction to Chi-chen Itza. He is not
    the only one who has been struck dumb by the first sight of the rugged
    and beautiful temple, high and huge above its surroundings. Coming back
    from the States one year, I made the acquaintance, on the boat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> of a
    middle-aged American and his charming daughter, who with some others
    composed a small party bound for Mérida, the capital of Yucatan. As I
    had been to Chi-chen Itza many times, I naturally, in my talk with this
    gentleman, was enthusiastic over the idea of showing him the ruined
    city, and finally the whole party decided to go there. We arrived at
    the little town of Dzitas, where the gentlemen on horseback, I on an
    ambling mule, and the rest in <i lang="myn">volans</i> set out for the City of the
    Well. All the way the members of the party took turns in joking me
    about my pet city and my stories concerning it. I was in every sense
    the tail of the procession, as my mule had decided ideas of its own,
    as mules have, and would travel no faster than a slow walk; but the
    rest of the party were not traveling on a bed of roses and there was
    no unwillingness to stop and wait for me while they composed ironical
    witticisms.</p>

  <p>When we came near to Chi-chen Itza I ranged my mule alongside the
    gentleman who was leader in the heckling. I did this knowing that we
    would travel almost to the Great Pyramid of El Castillo and then, at a
    sharp turn to the right, view it completely and suddenly.</p>

  <p>My friend was in the middle of another verbal dig when the sight smote
    him. His mouth simply remained open. I have not yet heard the last of
    his apologies for his previous jesting remarks and I find my revenge
    very sweet.</p>

  <p>The pyramid, or terrace, on which El Castillo stands is two hundred
    feet square and rises to a height of seventy-five or eighty feet. The
    exact height is rather difficult to measure because of the debris at
    the bottom. The top of the terrace has a level surface, or platform,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
    sixty feet square, upon which stands the temple. The four sides of the
    pyramid rise steeply at an angle of fifty degrees and the pyramid is
    terraced, each terrace being nine feet high, with a narrow horizontal
    offset. The rises are faced with cut stone beautifully paneled. Each of
    the four pyramid faces is vertically bisected by a wide stone stairway
    more gentle in its incline than the angle of the pyramid itself but
    still very long and steep. The stairs start at the top flush with the
    ledge upon which the temple stands and draw away farther and farther,
    as they descend, from the plane of the pyramid face, with an increasing
    ratio of projection so that at the bottom they project an appreciable
    distance beyond the pyramid base. Thus the stairways pleasingly break
    the monotony of line—which is good art and good architecture. Like all
    Maya stairways, they have narrow treads and high risers.</p>

  <p>The cult of Kukul Can, indicated everywhere in the City of the Sacred
    Well, nowhere attains so overshadowing an importance as here in this
    vast temple. Each of the four corners of the pyramid is bounded by the
    huge undulating body of a stone serpent, extending from the ground
    clear to the top of the pyramid. Each undulation of the serpent’s body
    marks a terrace or gradient and to lift a single stone section of one
    of these mammoth serpents would be a task for a dozen men. Everywhere
    on the horizontal levels of the terraces springs up each year a thick
    growth of grasses as high as a tall man’s head.</p>

  <p>The principal stairway, facing the north, is guarded at the base by
    two huge heads of feathered serpents, jaws open, fangs displayed,
    and forked tongues extended. And each of these heads, excepting only
    the forked tongue, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> hewn from a single solid block of stone, with
    every crotalic detail perfectly carved. The bodies belonging to these
    serpent heads, conventionalized into two broad, flat bands, extend up
    the mound, one on each side of the stairway, to the principal entrance
    of the temple. On the narrow platform and forming the main doorway of
    this holy of holies are two more immense monolithic serpent heads,
    now partially destroyed. They are used as pillars trisecting into
    three parts the great forty-foot doorway. The conventionalized and
    foreshortened head of the serpent forms the base of the column and the
    foreshortened tail forms the capital which is, in its own way, no less
    a worthy architectural creation than the Greek Corinthian column, with
    its capital of acanthus leaves.</p>

  <p>The triply vaulted ceiling rests upon great sapote beams supported by
    three-foot-thick walls and massive square-faced, paneled stone pillars.
    This sapote wood, called <i>ya</i> by the natives, is dark red in color and
    turns chocolate brown with age and exposure. It is nearly as heavy
    as iron and is very hard. In many ways it resists the action of the
    tropical elements better than metal, and insects seem to produce no
    effect upon its adamantine surface. These beams are wondrously carved
    and with few exceptions have faithfully sustained the tremendous weight
    of stone put upon them. Only a few have broken with age, so that but
    a part of the façade of the temple has fallen. For a thousand years,
    at least, they have stood and at the time of the Conquest in 1540 they
    were in much the same condition in which we now find them.</p>

  <p>In front of the main doorway originally stood a great stone table
    with an intricately carved surface. It was supported by curious
    Atlantean stone figures and some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> these strange male caryatids were
    bearded. Other figures on piers and columns within the temple also are
    bearded—with one exception the only bearded figures portrayed in this
    whole city which was inhabited by a beardless race. Close examination
    shows, however, that the carved figures wear masks and it is the masks
    which are bearded. This fact only enhances the mystery, pointing to the
    possibility of a still more ancient past and of ritualistic traditions
    so remote in their beginnings that all memory of their original meaning
    has faded and only the ritual or empty shell remains of what was once
    living fact. Analogous are some of the archaic Greek rituals and
    Druidical rites.</p>

  <p>Who were the prototypes of these bearded figures? Were they the
    mysterious, blue-eyed, fair-skinned people clad in armor who were
    supposed to have once landed at Tamoclan near Tampico? Norsemen? Or
    were they the old Atlanteans whose country Plato says “sank in one day
    and one night beneath the waves of the ocean”?</p>

  <p>Of the many marvelous carvings and paintings in this temple I shall say
    more in another chapter.</p>

  <p>Doubtless upon the wide level roof of the temple were performed
    religious rites,—solemn invocations to the sun and the like,—for,
    throughout, this edifice leaves one with the impression that its
    character was purely religious. There are no warlike scenes pictured,
    only solemnity and high reverence for the great gods.</p>

  <p>Lying within the shadow of El Castillo are the broken remains of
    another building, called the Temple of the Tigers. It takes its name
    from a frieze of bas-reliefs which is one of the outstanding treasures
    of the lost art of the Mayas. In these wonderful carvings the sculptor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
    has perfectly caught the feline vigor and grace of the American jaguar.
    No doubt he had a first-hand knowledge of jaguars, which were very
    plentiful then and still abound in this vicinity if one wishes to
    go to the trouble of looking for them. To the Mayas the jaguar was
    the “Protector of the Fields” because he lay in wait for the deer in
    the open and cultivated spaces. It was the custom of the natives to
    put some gift or friendly token in the corner of the field for this
    god-like beast. Probably his very life was sacred as are those of many
    animals in India.</p>

  <p>The Tiger Temple is built on a pyramid base with a stairway up the
    side approaching a wide doorway which is divided by pillars into
    three parts. Much of the sustaining pyramid has crumbled away, or
    been removed, leaving the building perched on a sheer wall of roughly
    cemented rubble as viewed from one side. The façade is thirty-five
    feet long and twenty-two feet high and at each side of the entrance is
    a great serpent’s head. Each of these monoliths weighs several tons
    and is carved with amazing skill; every feature and scale is flawless
    and they are painted or enameled, the colors being still visible if
    not vivid. The head of each is green, while eyes and open mouth are
    red. The scales end with the head, and the remainder of the body,
    elaborately feathered, rises in a graceful cylindrical column, with
    the tail now broken but originally projecting upward along the face
    of the building and terminating in well-defined rattles. A portion
    of the front roof has fallen, due to the breaking of wooden lintels
    supporting the mass of stone of which it was composed, but fortunately
    the serpents’ heads and the door columns are unharmed.</p>

  <p>All of the interior walls are solidly painted with battle <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>scenes,
    scenes of domestic life, and pictures of sacrificial pageants. Many
    of the colors are as brilliant as the day they were laid on these
    smooth walls, although the wonderful paintings have been much marred
    by vandals. The many figures, each in a different posture, each
    group differently clothed or armed, and all cleverly drawn, in good
    proportion, and elaborately colored, are capable of holding the most
    casual observer by the hour and are a never-ending delight to the
    enthusiast.</p>

  <p>The Tiger Temple is in every way the prize exhibit among the
    various edifices of the Sacred City, not for its size but for the
    craftsmanship and charm of its every detail. And yet I must make one
    small reservation, for just back and at the base of the Tiger Temple
    is a small, almost ruined building, nameless, lacking a roof and a
    front, yet containing on its three still standing walls and what little
    remains of a ceiling more than eighty sculptured figures. There are
    warriors in armor of metal, hide, and wood; priests in ceremonial
    vestments; kings and chieftains. The various figures are distinct
    and different from one another and the features are individual,
    doubtless recognizable if we but knew the great men in whose likeness
    they were carved. Each figure is identified by its own personal and
    distinguishing sign, or mark, usually placed overhead. Vivid paint or
    enamel was painstakingly applied to the sculpture and in many places it
    is still pronounced.</p>

  <p>Some of the work is crude, other parts exquisitely refined, indicating
    that it is not all the work of one man. I am told by those well versed
    in stone-carving and the making of bas-reliefs that even with modern
    stone-cutting tools it would take one man at least twenty years
    to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> accomplish this work. For lack of a better name I always call
    this wonderful roofless place the Temple of Bas-Reliefs. When first
    observed, the sculptured walls look merely like a variegated patchwork.
    In order to see it at its best one should arrive at about ten o’clock
    in the morning, at which time the shadows cast by the background bring
    out all the raised parts in strong contrast and the whole procession
    of priests and warriors marches clearly before one’s eyes. The south
    wall, however, can be seen at its best only for a short time soon after
    sunrise and it is well worth the discomfort of early rising. Very
    probably there was an arrangement of smooth-faced, light-reflecting
    pillars in this building which caused all the walls to stand out in
    bold relief.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the floor and facing the entrance squats a stone
    jaguar. Perhaps upon his broad, flat back may have been placed holy
    offerings to the gods.</p>

  <p>The fallen front of this temple was once supported by two finely carved
    and painted square columns, still majestically erect, and remindful of
    those other ancient temples of Greece and Egypt.</p>

  <p>And now we come to what is perhaps the most curious thing in the whole
    metropolis. The Tiger Temple, the Temple of Bas-Reliefs, and two other
    buildings surrounded a great inclosure having a flat paved floor
    four hundred and twenty feet long, bounded on the sides by smooth,
    perpendicular walls more than twenty feet high and thirty feet thick.</p>

  <p>A hundred feet from the northern extremity of this extraordinary court
    and facing it is a building consisting of a single chamber. Its front
    wall is lacking, but arising from the rubbish are two ornamented round
    columns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> which were evidently the supports for the wall. The whole
    interior of the building, from floor to peak, is covered with worn and
    faded bas-reliefs. In the center of the rear wall is the perfect figure
    of a man, bearded and with decidedly Hebraic features.</p>

  <p>At the opposite end of the court and a hundred feet back from it is a
    building extending nearly the entire width of the court. The roof of
    this structure has fallen, but the remains of sculptured square columns
    are visible.</p>

  <p>And on the two side walls of the court, on the precise middle line,
    were mounted two great carved stone rings, like millstones, twenty feet
    above the floor. Each ring is beautifully carved with the entwined
    bodies of serpents. The rings are four feet in diameter and a foot
    thick, and the hole in each is one foot seven inches in diameter. One
    of these rings is still mounted in the masonry of the wall, while its
    counterpart once on the adjacent wall has fallen, but, happily, is
    unbroken.</p>

  <p>A very similar court and similar rings have been found at Uxmal,
    another ancient Maya city of Yucatan.</p>

  <p>Obviously this court was intended for some public game and it has
    therefore been given the name of the Tennis-court or Gymnasium. In
    an account of the diversions of Montezuma, given by Herrera, who
    accompanied Cortes, is the following illuminating description:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Emperor took much delight in seeing the game of ball which
      the Spaniards have since prohibited due to the mischief which
      often happens at the game. By the Aztecs this game was called
      <i lang="myn">tlachtli</i>—being like our tennis. The ball was made from the
      gum of a tree that grows in hot countries, which, after having
      holes made in it, distills great white drops that soon harden
      and being worked and molded together, this material turns as
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
      black as pitch.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The balls made thereof, although quite
      hard and heavy to the hand, did bound and fly as well as our
      footballs and there was no need to blow them, nor did they use
      staves. They struck the ball with any part of the body as it
      happened or as they could most conveniently. Sometimes he lost
      who touched it with any other part but his hips, which was
      looked upon among them as very dexterous and for the purpose
      that the ball might rebound better they fastened a piece of
      stiff leather on to their hips. They might strike the ball
      every time it rebounded, which it would do several times one
      after another, in so much that it looked as if it had been
      alive. They played in parties, so many on each side, for a load
      of mantles or what the gamesters could afford. They also played
      for gold and feather work and sometimes they played themselves
      away. The place where they played was a ground room, long,
      narrow and high and higher at the sides than at the ends. They
      kept the walls plastered and smooth, also the floor. On the
      side walls they fixed certain stones like those used in a mill,
      with a hole quite through the middle. The hole was just as big
      as the ball and he who could strike it through thereby won the
      game, and in token of its being an extraordinary success which
      rarely happened, he had the right to the cloaks of all the
      lookers-on.</p>

    <p>It was very pleasant to see that as soon as ever the ball was
      in the hole, those standing by took to their heels, running
      away with all their might to save their cloaks, laughing and
      rejoicing, while others scoured after them to secure their
      cloaks for the winner, who was obliged to offer some sacrifice
      to the idol of the Court and to the stone whose hole the ball
      had passed.</p>

    <p>Every Court had a temple day where at midnight they performed
      certain ceremonies and enchantments on the two walls and on the
      middle of the floor, singing certain songs or ballads, after
      which a priest of the Great Temple went with some of their
      religious men to bless it. He uttered some words, threw the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
      ball about the court four times (towards the four points of
      the compass) and then it was consecrated and might be played
      in, but not before.</p>

    <p>The owner of the Court, who was also a lord, never played
      without making some offering and performing some ceremony to
      the Idol of the Game, which shows how superstitious they were
      even in their diversions.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This account which has come down to us will save much head-scratching
    on the part of future archæologists as to the purpose of the unique
    court and its carved millstones.</p>

  <p>The Gymnasium or Tennis-court and the buildings surrounding it were not
    pure Mayan, but were unquestionably introduced under the Nahuatl or
    Aztec régime.</p>

  <p>Nearly all of the remaining buildings are in too bad a condition to
    yield much of further interest until careful digging and replacing
    of fallen parts can restore them to some semblance of their original
    form. One such fallen temple on a great pyramid is now marked only
    by four nine-foot pillars whose square sides are chiseled with
    queer bearded figures, some of whom carry what I can only call a
    “rabbit-stick”—evidently some sort of ceremonial staff or wand. These
    pillars were unquestionably the front of an immense temple whose wooden
    lintels have given way, letting fall the whole edifice. In front of
    this ruin were several stone tables, and apparently they stretched at
    one time, end to end, clear across the base of the pyramid. The tables
    were of various heights and consisted of stone slabs six inches thick
    and about three feet wide. They were supported by grotesque dwarfish
    Atlantean figures with upraised hands, the palms held flat and on a
    level with their heads. While grotesque, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> figures have much
    dignity and sureness of line. Originally they were brightly painted.</p>

  <p>The tables have been so disarranged that it is impossible to tell what
    was their original position or even to guess at their purpose. The
    temple faced west, as indicated by the broken stairway leading up to
    it. In the midst of the debris lies a fractured serpent column nearly
    five feet in length, with a stone tongue projecting two feet from its
    fanged lips. The column rising from the serpent’s head is two feet in
    diameter and its capital was the creature’s tail. The broken outlines
    of a rear chamber reached through a vestibule just behind the serpent
    column measure thirty-six by fifteen feet. The doorway of the chamber
    has square-cut, sculptured jambs.</p>

  <p>A few hundred feet to the north is the ruined Temple of the Cones.
    Strewn all about are large cone-shaped stones like big projectiles, but
    cut and carved. It is thought that they formed some sort of ornamental
    frieze. Some are handsomely sculptured. There are also in this vicinity
    figures of the Chac Mool type—an animal body, usually a jaguar, with
    the head of a man.</p>

  <p>Some distance to the right of El Castillo are the ruins of what must
    have been a very important temple. They occupy a great irregular mound
    some six hundred feet long and are bordered by several pyramids and
    other ruins of varied character. The largest of the pyramids is fifty
    feet high and stands in the northwest corner of the group of ruins.
    All that remains of it are columns, but there are almost a forest of
    them, some round, some square. We have called this ruin the Temple of
    Columns. It seems as though here must have been an elaborate plaza of
    temples, colonnades, and sunken courts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> Even now archæologists from
    the Carnegie Foundation of Washington, D.C., are at work in reclaiming
    this portion of the Sacred City from the jungle, clearing the debris
    and working out the jig-saw puzzle of replacing each fallen stone in
    its rightful position.</p>

  <p>Everywhere for miles one comes upon huddled debris-covered mounds and
    carved stones. In the very heart of the jungle is the overgrown ruin
    of a tremendous pyramid and temple, while here and there unexpected
    columns rise amid the trees. More than thirty such ruins have been
    counted, choked by rank jungle growth—palaces, no doubt, of high
    priests and mighty chieftains. And I think sadly as I view them that
    the study of archæology is long and time is fleeting.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
      <span class="small">AN IDLE DAY IN THE JUNGLE</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">SEVERAL thousands of years before that sturdy Scotch engineer John
    MacAdam gave to the world the broken-rock road surface known as
    “macadam,” which has done so much to make communication easier, roads
    were built in Yucatan that embodied all of his sound principles of
    road-making. And MacAdam lived and died without ever having heard
    of them. In fact, he had been sleeping beneath the green sod of his
    native kirk for at least a decade before Europe or North America knew
    that these old roads of Yucatan existed. The thoroughness and good
    engineering of their construction rival the famous roads of the Roman
    Empire or of present-day highways.</p>

  <p>In ancient times Chi-chen Itza and all the great and lesser cities of
    the Yucatan peninsula were linked by a network of smooth, hard-surfaced
    highways. The Mayas of to-day call these old roads <i lang="myn">zac-be-ob</i>, or
    white ways. The name is of ancient origin, used, perhaps, by the
    very builders themselves and no doubt these roads were like ribbons
    stretching mile after mile through field and forest and deserving
    quite as much the appellation of “White Way” as any of our blazing
    night-lighted thoroughfares.</p>

  <p>But alas! they are no longer white, no longer even distinguishable as
    roads for any great distance, but are buried beneath matted roots and
    brown earth. And this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> land which once had the best roads on earth
    became a place where until recently good roads were unknown, where
    every cow-path was called <i lang="es">camino real</i> or royal road but was decidedly
    unregal.</p>

  <p>Don Eduardo has painstakingly studied the old highways and for the rest
    of this chapter I will merely repeat what he has so often told me:</p>

  <p>“The old roads, each and every one, went down to bed-rock, and upon that
    solid foundation was built up a ballast of broken limestone, with the
    larger stones at the bottom. As the surface of the road was reached,
    smaller stones were used and the crevices were filled in. And the whole
    face of the road was given a smooth, hard coating of a mortar cement of
    lime and finely sifted white earth, known then and to-day as <i lang="myn">zac-cab</i>.
    The hard-pan of Yucatan is limestone ledge rock and as a rule it is not
    very far beneath the surface soil. Often in the building of roads the
    first layer or ballast consisted of large boulders, not merely tumbled
    in haphazard, but carefully placed and with the interstices filled in
    with smaller stones, painstakingly fitted and hammered into place. Thus
    a firm anchorage was provided that has held through the centuries.
    The second and third courses, each of smaller boulders and stones,
    were quite as carefully placed. The final course was constructed of
    stones the size of a bushel basket and smaller, wedged together with
    rock fragments. Within a foot or so of the desired road-level, rock
    fragments from the size of an egg to that of a small walnut were
    leveled in, a grouting made, and the whole pounded until a hard, level
    surface was obtained. Mortar or cement was then applied in a thin
    coating and when this had hardened sufficiently gangs of stout-muscled
    laborers <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>armed with smooth, fine-grained polishing-stones rubbed the
    plastic surface until it became compacted into a polished flatness
    almost as smooth-coated as tile and nearly as hard.</p>

  <p>“The majority of the stones used were not quarried but were isolated
    boulders rounded by erosion and stained with iron from the ‘red earth’
    in which they are usually found. Seldom was any rock used which could
    easily be cut and used for the construction of buildings or temples.</p>

  <p>“These old highways—what a tremendous labor they must have been! What
    miles and miles of carrying the stones to build them! And nothing but
    man-power to move the huge boulders. Centuries, perhaps, were spent in
    the building, and millions of sweating men.</p>

  <p>“Their traffic problems did not concern vehicles, not even horses
    nor other beasts of burden. The roads were built for travelers afoot
    and the burden-carriers were men, traveling in single file as human
    carriers do the world over. And yet there must have been much traffic,
    for some of these roads are twenty-five feet in width, so that four
    files of men with their loads could easily pass, two lines going one
    way and two in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>“The largest and longest of these ancient roadways connects Chi-chen
    Itza with the once important cities of Uxmal and Tiho. It is
    twenty-five feet wide. The long road from Chi-chen Itza to ancient
    Zac-ci (now Valladolid) and the unnamed but important towns between
    Zac-ci and Lake Co-ba, is bifurcated again and again into more and more
    narrow highways, resembling creeks flowing together to form eventually
    a mighty river.</p>

  <p>“What a picture these forgotten roads must have been in the golden
    age of the Mayas!—pulsing with life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> crowded with water-carriers,
    venders, idlers, pious pilgrims, nobles with their retinues, farmers
    bringing their produce to the city, itinerant craftsmen, rich men,
    beggarmen, thieves; a cheerful jostling of motley and purple; a riot of
    color and of all the things men buy and sell.</p>

  <p>“Came a squad of soldiers, crystal-tipped lances glinting in the
    sunlight; or a solemn procession of priests and devotees with sacred
    whistles shrilling or the boom of the <i lang="myn">tunkul</i>, while the laughing
    crowd parted and made silent obeisance to the holy ones.</p>

  <p>“Along the sides of the road every now and then are low raised
    platforms, or elevations, which have lost all semblance of their
    pristine contours, so that one can only guess at their purpose. It
    has been suggested that they were originally hollowed out and were
    <i lang="myn">holtunes</i>, hollow stones, or water-reservoirs, where the traveler
    might quench his thirst. My own examination of them convinces me
    that they were, for the major part at least, nothing more than
    resting-places where the carrier might deposit his load, letting
    slip the band from about his forehead which held the burden on his
    shoulders. And well he might rest, this ancestor of the present sturdy
    Maya, for he bore just as incredibly heavy burdens for as incredibly
    long distances.</p>

  <p>“There is a striking similarity in the practical engineering of the
    Maya roadways and the construction of the stone terraces upon which the
    temples were built. One day, bent upon the study of such construction
    and to verify certain conclusions I had reached, I had recourse to
    a deep excavation made in the base mound or pyramid of an important
    fallen structure which is located some distance north of the Great
    Pyramid of El Castillo.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> This excavation, so some of the natives told
    me, had been made by a ‘stranger’ (white man), short of body but
    thick-set and very powerful. He was, they said, ‘a very positive man,
    with a long gray beard, and this was so long ago that few are now alive
    who remember.’ No one who has ever seen and known the late Doctor Le
    Plongeon, intrepid investigator and discoverer of the famous monumental
    ‘Chac Mool’ figure, could fail to recognize the faithfulness of this
    native description. And from all his years of labor Doctor Le Plongeon
    evolved a Mayan theology which is either inspired or the result of
    a mentality unhinged by too great labor. Certainly it seems to be
    imagination run wild, with little of fact to bear it out. It is no less
    than tragic, for never did archæologist drive himself to more herculean
    effort than did Le Plongeon.</p>

  <p>“To resume my story, this excavation was like a deep chasm, bisecting
    the crowning platform and going clear down to bed-rock, and thus it
    fitted perfectly my purpose. Nearly forty years had passed since Le
    Plongeon made the excavation, and Nature had done her best with wind
    and rain and vegetation to heal the wound. Loosened material from
    the sides of the cut had fallen in, providing an excellent bed for
    climbing vines, saplings, and big-leafed plants. The roots of big
    trees, no longer supported by the stones, had given way and the trees
    had fallen, bridging with their trunks the crevice. Vines, saplings,
    and flowering plants grew up and twined about and embraced the bridging
    tree trunks, so that one would scarcely know without close scrutiny
    that an excavation had been made. The two tree trunks which lay side by
    side, bridging the space overhead, were both of hardwood. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>One was a
    <i lang="myn">yax-nic</i>, light-colored and with bark of silver gray, while the other
    was a <i lang="myn">chac-ti</i>, dark red and with loose-held bark, in decay separating
    from the trunk in long, curling ribbons.</p>

  <p>“Near me were many big spiders, flat, crab-like and motionless, yet
    with bright pin-point eyes that seemed fiercely awake, waiting and
    watching for whatever prey might come to their nipper-like jaws.
    Their long legs and still longer caliper-pointed antennæ lay sprawled
    flat against the tree trunks so close that on casual inspection the
    creatures might pass for bits of tree fungus. Small lizard-like
    reptiles, with beautiful diamond-like eyes and heads as ugly as sin,
    sprinted up and down the tree trunks and under and over the branches,
    skilfully avoiding the spiders and other dangers. Both spiders and tiny
    lizards on the <i lang="myn">yax-nic</i> trunk were gray in color, blending perfectly
    with the bark surface, while those on the <i lang="myn">chac-ti</i> trunk were dull
    red to match the bark—an example of natural camouflage or protective
    coloring as striking as any I have ever seen.</p>

  <p>“Out came the powerful pocket magnifying-glass which I always carry.
    While looking at a gorgeous little insect decked in gold and green, I
    became aware of a commotion in the <i lang="myn">yax-nic</i> tree and turned the lens
    in that direction. What I saw was a fearsome-looking head and a body
    that was no less than an walking horror. The head seemed to be all jaws
    and glittering eyes—deep, powerful grinding mandibles that worked like
    steel-cutting shears; eyes lidless, unblinking, bulging, and coldly
    cruel. And the whole body and pointed legs were incased in gray armor
    of metallic luster. It was with a sigh of relief that I laid down the
    lens and realized that I had been gazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> only at a spider and not some
    antediluvian monster. Except for the comforting fact of relativity of
    size between man and these creatures, I doubt if there ever existed
    three more terrifying animals than the crab-like spider, <i lang="myn">chin-tun</i>,
    the tiny crested lizard, <i lang="myn">hu</i>, and the giant-armored ant, <i lang="myn">choch</i>,
    whose sting is worse than that of the scorpion, often producing fever
    and sometimes death.</p>

  <p>“Directly overhead, between the fallen trees, I could see growing at
    the top of the mound the thorny <i lang="myn">katzin</i>, one long branch of which
    swayed over the brink of the man-made chasm. And almost at the very tip
    of this branch hung the pensile nest of an oriole, with the brilliant
    feathered male singing his lungs out beside it. The gold-and-black
    plumage against the green leaves and the glossy jet-black Spanish moss
    of which the nest was made produced a picture that Gauguin would surely
    have longed to put on canvas. Suddenly his song ended in a high-pitched
    scream, as a brown hawk swooped from the sky and clutched not the bird
    but the nest. With one scaly talon the pirate gripped the neck of the
    nest, while with the other he tore at its woven bottom. He worked like
    a flash, but my revolver flashed yet more quickly and effectively. The
    mother bird and the eggs, I think, were saved, but the nest was sadly
    in need of the work of an expert in oriole nest-repairing and I imagine
    it was some time before the master of the house recovered sufficiently
    from his fright to resume his liquid melody. At least I heard no more
    from him that day, although every other bird in the neighborhood
    immediately dropped what he was doing and came over to view the damage
    and condole with or congratulate the victims of the assault, so that it
    was a full ten minutes before the jungle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> resumed its habitual quiet
    and the averted tragedy was sufficiently forgotten for the near-by
    <i lang="myn">dzaypkin</i>, or tree cicada, to resume his not unmusical note that
    sounds like a muted automobile siren.</p>

  <p>“I had outlined my work for the morrow, selected the place where the
    shovel should follow out the prodigious work of Le Plongeon, gone these
    many years. I had even snapped the rubber band back on my note-book
    and was turning my thoughts luncheonward when almost between my feet
    I heard a frightened squeak and saw a small brown rabbit dart from
    the opening under the stone ledge on which I was sitting and scurry
    into the adjoining underbrush at a speed incredible even for a much
    frightened bunny.</p>

  <p>“This looked promising and I concluded to sit a while longer and wait
    developments. Only a few seconds elapsed before there emerged from the
    same hole the blunt ophidian head of an enormous boa-constrictor. The
    unpleasant creature came out uncertainly and the ugly head wavered
    about nearly on a level with my knees and much too close for comfort.
    Boas, I think, have not a very keen power of scent. This one, at least,
    seemed to take up the trail of the rabbit with some difficulty. Yet I
    can believe, too, that that particular rabbit got over the ground so
    quickly that he left no scent whatever. Or it is possible that the near
    presence of an unseen human being bewildered the scent faculties of the
    huge snake.</p>

  <p>“You may be sure that I had kept very, very still, trying to believe
    what has so often been told me—that few jungle creatures recognize man
    by his form alone as long as he remains silent and motionless. At any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
    rate, the big reptile finally started in the general direction taken by
    the rabbit, which no doubt was several hundred miles away by that time
    if he had maintained his initial rate of travel. Apparently the same
    idea came to the boa, for he soon reappeared and, still heedless of my
    presence, passed almost between my legs and reëntered what appeared
    to be his permanent home, on the ground floor of the pyramid, in the
    interstices between the big stones which formed its base.</p>

  <p>“After making sure that he had entirely gone in and, figuratively
    speaking, closed the door after him, I took his measurements from
    observations on certain stone projections he had passed. He was not
    less than sixteen and a half feet long. Deciding that I had had quite
    enough adventure for one morning, I bade the spot adieu and went home
    to lunch.”</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
      <span class="small">THE SACRED WELL</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">YUCATAN has a peculiar geological structure. The soil is usually very
    thin, and beneath it is porous limestone rock. Owing to the thinness of
    the soil, vegetation, prolific as it is, does not grow high and the few
    large trees grow only where the bed-rock has in some way been broken,
    thus providing depth of soil for the roots.</p>

  <p>The limestone foundation is of minute sea-shells, for it was all once
    sea-bottom; and this porous rock is very subject to erosion, so that
    the whole peninsula is honeycombed with subterranean streams and
    channels and caves, while every here and there are natural wells,
    or cenotes. Some, like the two greater wells at Chi-chen Itza, are
    very wide and deep; others are tiny. Nowhere is the elevation above
    sea-level great, and many of these natural wells extend down to
    sea-level and are fed by seepage from the sea. Others, of course, are
    partly fed by surface drainage and nearly all provide an inexhaustible
    supply of water. Indeed, I believe that it would be practically
    impossible to provide any pumping equipment which would drain the huge
    Sacred Well.</p>

  <p>In the case of nearly all these wells, except those very close to the
    sea-coast, the water does not contain salt or minerals evident to the
    taste, as the limestone rock is a perfect filter. The water, however,
    as might be expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> in this tropical setting, is fairly alive with
    animalcula. One soon becomes accustomed to such fleshy nourishment in
    his beverage and ceases to find it unpleasant.</p>

  <p>In the dry season the cenotes provide virtually the only water-supply,
    because there are almost no lakes or surface streams. Owing to the
    porosity of the rock, moisture sinks into the earth very rapidly and in
    only a little while after a heavy rain the ground is again quite dry.
    To-day, as in ancient times, life is dependent upon the natural wells
    and it is easy to see why the city of Chi-chen Itza was located as it
    is. On every hacienda, the manor is built adjacent to a cenote. So,
    too, are the villages. While cenotes are not rare, still they are not
    common enough to provide a convenient water-supply for the majority of
    the populace.</p>

  <p>In Mérida the wealthy inhabitants have cenotes upon their grounds,
    providing delightful places to bathe. And around them many pretty
    grottos or underground chambers have been hollowed out from the rock
    by artificial means, where it is always cool and where the families
    resort in the heat of the day. Cenotes are often found in the jungle
    and sometimes are ideal places for hunting. Where the well has sloping
    walls or a reasonably good path down to the water, it is sure to be
    patronized by wild animals of all kinds. Many cenotes contain fish,
    especially catfish.</p>

  <p>One device employed in olden times and still used to augment the
    water-supply is a shallow reservoir, or cistern, called a chultun
    (stone calabash), which fills with water in the rainy season and tides
    over, to a certain extent, the arid months. But it is usually a dry
    hole before the dry season is far advanced. These rain-cisterns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> are
    of all sizes and shapes. There are a few ruined cities, like Uxmal,
    which had no cenotes or other natural water-supply and which must have
    depended solely upon the impounded water of many chultuns.</p>

  <p>The inexhaustible natural wells were early utilized by the Spanish
    plantation-owners, who in the irrigation of their fields employed the
    noria, that ancient, rather clumsy big wheel with water-buckets or
    dippers fastened to its periphery. It is in operation to-day in Yucatan
    just as it is in Spain and the Levant.</p>

  <p>At Chi-chen Itza are three main cenotes and some lesser ones. The
    Sacred Well was called “Chen Ku” (<i lang="myn">Chen</i> means “well”) and was never
    called <i lang="myn">dzonot</i>, or cenote, which gives the impression that the great
    well may have been made by human effort or at least was thus enlarged.
    Perhaps, however, this idea that human agency was employed in its
    construction may have arisen mostly from the fact of its circular form
    and perpendicular sides, which may quite logically have been the work
    of Nature alone, or Nature aided by man. De Sander speaks of this well
    as having been formed in part by man, and I think his theory is not
    improbable. But surely the great well is, for the most part, a work of
    Nature.</p>

  <p>Tol-oc, the next largest well in the Sacred City, was the main source
    of potable water. In ancient times a stone stairway led down into its
    waters. To-day the upper steps are gone, but one can see a clearly
    defined line of chiseled steps some three feet or more beneath the
    surface and adjacent to these is distinguishable another line of steps.
    Don Eduardo thinks the stairway originally consisted of a broad flight
    leading from the top of the well down to the water-level and that at
    its base<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> was a narrow stone platform. It is impossible to determine
    now how wide the stairway was, or whether or not his surmise is correct
    that there was a platform at the bottom.</p>

  <p>His conclusions were made several years ago, when the water in the well
    was unusually low. The fact that the rise and fall of the water-level
    in this cenote bears little if any relation to local rain-fall leads
    to the belief that its principal source is far distant and comes down
    through some permeable rock strata, until by reason of a rock fault
    it gushes up into the well of Tol-oc. Overhanging the wall are large
    trees, orchid-covered, whose delicate perfume floats down to meet the
    water. There are orchids here that would quickly make a fortune for a
    New York florist.</p>

  <p>At first sight the water seems dust-covered and turgid, but the dust
    on the surface is only pollen from the orchids and the big lilies that
    cluster against the cliff-like walls. It is therefore good, clean, and
    deeply poetic dust, and beneath the surface the water is crystal clear
    and cold as any bubbling New England spring. To bathe in Tol-oc is an
    unalloyed joy.</p>

  <p>The large cenote of X-Katum also is on the outskirts of the city and
    is famous among the natives to-day for the purity and softness of its
    water. It has no recorded history nor traditions, but the worn grooves
    in the solid stone of its brink, where ropes have raised and lowered
    countless jars for countless centuries, is testimony more eloquent than
    words.</p>

  <p>The many other cenotes in and around the city all contain very pure
    water and are apparently inexhaustible. Around them are the remains
    in stone and mortar of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> were surely important structures. Near
    the cenote of Yula, which is almost six miles from the center of the
    ancient city, Don Eduardo was fortunate enough to uncover a large stone
    tablet, one side of which is entirely filled with clear, minutely
    carved hieroglyphs.</p>

  <p>The Via Sacra—the causeway, once so straight and smooth, leading to
    the Sacred Well—is now in bad condition, its outline dulled by time.
    Great trees border it and their branches arch overhead, while their
    roots have raised and broken the smooth avenue until it no longer
    resembles a road. Smaller trees are rooted in the roadway itself.</p>

  <p>The Sacred Well is a great pit, with sheer stone sides which are
    slightly irregular. Its form is elliptical, almost circular. At the
    side nearest the Great Pyramid is a small ruined sanctuary where the
    last rites were performed before a maiden was thrown into the well to
    become the bride of the Rain God. The ground for some distance about
    this sanctuary was paved with stones. The Sacred Well, at whose bottom
    dwelt Yum Chac, the Rain God, is more than one hundred and sixty feet
    wide and as one gazes down its vertical sides, the drop to the water
    seems tremendous; indeed it is fully seventy feet.</p>

  <p>The sheer wall of the well is laminated, split horizontally into two
    thousand bands or strata of limestone, of various widths. Some of these
    bands appear hardly thicker than a sheet of paper, others as wide as
    a house is high, and every lamination is separated from its neighbor
    by a sandwich filling of thin lime-powder. The striated appearance is
    very striking, because the laminations are dead black except where
    vines, trees, and orchids or other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> parasitic plants or fungi cling
    to and lend color to the surface. The layers of lime-dust between the
    strata of rock are either pure white or cream-colored. The powder
    has a hard-packed coherency, but the elements—sun, wind, and rain
    together—loosen enough of it so that the plants and the surface of the
    water are always covered with a thin film of dust. All about the edge
    of the well is a fringe of trees, and a surprising amount of vegetation
    has found a root-hold between the rock laminations of the perpendicular
    walls.</p>

    <div class="caption">THIS PLAN INDICATES THE GENERAL SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE
      SACRED WELL AND THE LOCATION OF THE SHRINE OF THE LAST RITES</div>
  </div>

  <p>The placid water of the pool is jade-green, due partly to the great
    depth, and partly, I believe, to traces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> certain salts or solubles
    in the water, although I cannot speak with certainty on this point, as
    I have never subjected it to chemical analysis. I have tried many, many
    times to get a really good photograph of the Sacred Well and have come
    to the conclusion that only the motion camera, or an airplane view can
    ever succeed in reproducing the sight. The “still” photograph, taken
    from the brink, shows either an expanse of wall and little water or
    much water and little wall. For this reason the illustration opposite
    <a href="#i_113">page 113</a> fails to show the whole well and does not begin to do justice
    to this most interesting, historic spot.</p>

  <p>As Don Eduardo and I sat on the crumbling walls of the shrine, at the
    very brink of the Sacred Well, he told me of his famous undertaking,
    now so successfully carried out—the removal of the ancient treasures
    from the very bottom of the Sacred Well.</p>

  <p>“For many years,” he said, “the thought of exploring the bottom of the
    Sacred Well had filled my mind. I thought about it by day and dreamed
    about it by night. It became a mania which would not let me rest and
    earned for me the reputation of being a little queer in the head. A
    thousand times I had gone over in my mind the practical ways and means
    that might be employed. Draining, dredging, or diving—it must be
    one of these three. I early became convinced that probably the well
    could not be drained, and certainly not with the slender finances at
    my command. I concluded at last that it could be dredged, and with
    comparatively simple equipment consisting of a stiff-legged derrick
    with a hand windlass, a long boom which might be swung out over the
    well, and a steel orange-peel buck-scoop, or bucket.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

  <p>“Simple as the undertaking sounds, it was beset at every turn with
    difficulties. The equipment, especially contrived and designed, was
    easily ordered in the United States and put aboard ship. Getting it
    ashore at Progreso, where it had to be unloaded five miles out and
    lightered to shore, was the first hard job. Loading it on flat-cars
    and finally unloading it at Dzitas, sixteen miles from my city, was
    no less difficult. With only native assistance, without trucks or
    anything adequate on wheels, and over the poorest excuse for a road,
    the equipment was moved piecemeal, until, after months of the hardest
    work I have ever done, it was all piled beside the Sacred Well.</p>

  <p>“Assembling the machinery was a task of shorter duration but no less
    strenuous. I would at that time have given gladly some years of my
    life for the services, for a few hours, of one or two brawny, profane,
    and competent Yankee ‘riggers.’ Time and again, before the cumbersome
    outfit was completely in place, I expected it to topple into the well
    or fall upon me and my Indians.</p>

  <p>“At last all was ready. My Indians, about thirty in number, each had
    his appointed task. The most trusted were to man the windlass and the
    turning of the boom from whose projecting end hung the cable-suspended
    dredging-scoop. The boom was swung out until it extended far over the
    well. I gave the signal and the steel bucket descended, disappeared
    under the green water, and at last came to rest on the bottom. Slowly
    the boom was swung back toward the brink of the pit and stopped. Eager
    hands manned the windlass to raise the bucket. Seemingly endless feet
    of wet cable were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> wound about the drum before the filled bucket
    broke the surface of the water. Up and up it rose, until it was on a
    level with our heads; then it was swung in by the boom and lowered to
    the spot which I had selected, where every precious scoopful should
    be minutely and painstakingly examined on the sorting-tables I had
    erected. No treasure must slip through our hands; nothing must be
    damaged by careless handling. Anything perishable must be immediately
    treated with the preservatives which were ready and waiting. My
    hands trembled, in spite of my effort to control them, as I emptied
    the contents of the scoop upon the sorting-tables, for soon I must
    be either ‘that clever chap who recovered the treasures from the
    Sacred Well in Yucatan’ or else the prize idiot of the whole Western
    Hemisphere.</p>

  <p>“I went over the muck, spreading it out, examining every bit of it, and
    found nothing; not a trace of anything interesting. It might just as
    well have come from any cesspool.</p>

  <p>“Again the winch revolved, its ratchets clinking against the brake. The
    big scoop, with its hungry steel lips wide open, plunged into the still
    water. The Sacred Well seemed sullen in the reflection of a black cloud
    overhead, as though determined to the very last to withhold its secrets.</p>

  <p>“And so it was, day after day. The winch rolled and unrolled its cable
    of steel and its manila ropes. The triple-pointed steel jaws dived into
    the soft, yielding muck many feet below the surface of the well, and
    came dripping up to deposit their burden. And day after day I found
    nothing but ill-smelling rotted leaves and a few stones, prevented from
    sinking into the mud by rotting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> tree branches which had fallen into
    the well and which, when not too decayed to stand the bite of the steel
    jaws, were brought up by the dredge. Sometimes whole trees were brought
    up and their weight made our steel cable sing like the string of a bass
    viol as the sodden mass was swung underneath the surface to free as
    much of it as possible and so reduce the weight before raising it clear
    of the water and dropping it again in another part of the pool where it
    sank with a splash and swirl of water.</p>

  <p>“At times the dredge, working between two entangled trees, was caught
    as in a trap and we experienced very real difficulties and dangers in
    freeing it. When the whole mass could be raised to the surface, agile
    natives with axes and machetes always managed to get down to it and,
    clinging precariously to cable and bucket, free it from its rotting
    incubus. For hours at a time we labored with such delaying obstacles,
    but always in the end the winch again rolled out its cable and then
    coiled it up with nothing but a mouthful of the mucky bed of the pool.</p>

  <p>“Several times we brought up the skeletons of deer or of wild hogs and
    once the tangled skeletons of a jaguar and a cow, mute evidence of a
    long-past forest tragedy—the cow feeding quietly, probably at night;
    the spring of the hungry forest cat and the agonized, purposeless
    flight of the bleeding quarry with the clawing jungle beast clinging
    to it; the last frantic leap into the well where both were doubtless
    stunned or killed by the seventy-foot drop to the surface of the water.</p>

  <p>“Then, for a long while, finds even as interesting as these ceased.
    Absolutely nothing was brought up but mud and leaves, leaves and
    mud, with an occasional stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> thrown in for good measure. My high
    hopes dwindled to nothing and became less than nothing. The work was
    interminable, nauseating. Doggedly I kept at it, however, determined
    not to stop until the absolute rock bottom of the well was reached. I
    tried not to let my Indians see that I was discouraged, but they did
    see it nevertheless and I think wondered every day how much longer the
    crazy stranger would persist in his foolishness and pay them high wages
    for bringing up mud, useless even as fertilizer, from the bottom of an
    abandoned well.</p>

  <p>“But Fate was even then preparing a pleasant surprise, for one day when
    things seemed darkest—a gloomy, rainy day when everything was soggy
    and sodden with moisture—the dredge brought up what first appeared
    to be two ostrich eggs, cream-colored and oval against the black mud
    in which they rested. These proved to be balls of copal incense and
    they revived at once my waning hopes. We had several times previously
    brought up fragments of earthenware which seemed to be of ancient
    origin and probably were, but I could not permit myself any illusions
    about them. Similar ancient potsherds are not uncommon on the surface
    of the ancient city. A boy ... some boy ... this year ... ten years
    ago ... a hundred years or ten centuries ago ... might have taken up
    a potsherd and skittered it into the well. Boy nature has not changed
    through the centuries and certainly no boy with a nice, flat chip of a
    water-jug at hand could have resisted the urge to see it skip far down
    and across the water of this big pool. And so the potsherds we brought
    up might well be ancient without having been long buried in the well.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

  <p>“But the balls of copal, or aromatic resin, left no doubt. Surely they
    were thrown into the Sacred Well as an offering to the Rain God in
    those long-past centuries when Chi-chen Itza was a great and holy city,
    the Mecca of the Mayas! With the evidence that this day brought forth
    came the conviction that the long siege was at an end and that it was
    merely a question of time before other and more important treasures
    would be brought to light. They proved to my satisfaction that the
    well did really have a religious significance in the olden days and
    therefore the legends concerning it were doubtless true in the main.</p>

  <p>“From that time on, nearly every shovelful contained some trove—balls
    of copal incense or baskets that had been filled with plastic copal.
    The basket-work had nearly all rotted away, but the deep impress of
    its weaving still remained on the masses of hardened copal. There were
    tripod vessels often filled with copal and rubber incense; wooden
    fragments of various forms and of unknown use but indicating the skill
    of some ancient craftsman. And among these wooden things were several
    pieces of wood made in the form of an old-fashioned English bill-hook
    or of a pruning-knife. My natives looked at them as they came up from
    the sacred pool and called them machetes of wood, but my heart sang
    with joy as I viewed them. No sword of damask steel, no Toledo blade
    could compare in historical value to these simple wooden implements,
    for they were, in the most primitive form, those strange weapons of the
    ancient Mayas and kindred races which the eye of the twentieth century
    had never previously beheld except in pictured form. These wooden
    weapons were dart-throwers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>— the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i> of the Mayas; the <i lang="myn">atlatl</i>
    of the Nahuatls. They are pictured many times upon the walls of the old
    temples. Warriors are shown in every attitude of throwing the dart from
    the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>.</p>

  <p>“The <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>, or throwing-stick, of the Mayas is in its most
    primitive form more elemental than the bow and arrow, more elemental
    even than the <i lang="myn">yun-tun</i>, or sling, for throwing stones. The first
    ones we brought up from the well were so near the birth-type that the
    hook was actually formed by the natural twist of the wood where the
    branch had been cut from the parent stem. In ages past, some jungle
    man, lacking a club and needing a weapon, pulled up a sapling that
    had attached at its root a secondary branch. As he gave the sapling a
    downward whirl, the secondary branch flew off at a tangent and straight
    as an arrow. Thus, probably, came the idea of the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>.</p>

  <p>“It is a singular and interesting fact that the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>, so
    universally used by the Mayas and their contiguous neighbors, is almost
    exactly duplicated by the bone or ivory throwing-stick of the Eskimos,
    while there are absolutely no traces of its use by the Aztecs or other
    northern Mexican peoples. In those dim ages when the human race was
    young—those ages as vague to us in outline and substance as the clouds
    that float across the sky—the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i> and not the bow was the common
    weapon of battle and the chase. Then we must suppose some great gelid
    cataclysm blotted out all humans throughout a whole region, leaving an
    ethnic break between the two extremes. Gradually the break was filled
    in by intrusive fragmentary races having no knowledge of the arts and
    weapons that had been before, leaving only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> extremes, the arctic
    and the tropic, with their descent of man and his arts unbroken.</p>

  <p>“Later on I was to have the keen pleasure of finding several votive and
    ceremonial examples of the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i> representing the highest artistic
    development. Possibly they are the very ones which served as models for
    the carvings showing such weapons in the hands of stately priests and
    other figures portrayed upon the walls and square stone columns of my
    Sacred City.</p>

  <p>“While the Mayas seem never to have used the bow and arrow, their
    neighbors to the north did. Possibly the Mayas actually preferred the
    more primitive and possibly more powerful weapon in whose use they
    were very expert, holding it in the hand with the hooked portion down
    and resting the feathered end of the dart upon it. The shaft of the
    dart lay between the fingers grasping the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>, with the pointed
    arrow-head even with the wrist. A powerful overhand motion of the arm
    or a side swing and release of the dart sent it hurtling through the
    air, and legend says that the dart thus thrown by a strong man might be
    driven clear through the body of a deer.</p>

  <p>“When these weapons of wood were brought up from the Sacred Well they
    seemed to be in as good condition as on the day, centuries before,
    when they were cast into the water; but almost immediately upon being
    exposed to the air they began to decompose and it was only by treating
    them immediately with preservatives that I was able to save them.</p>

  <p>“With the copal balls and baskets and the wooden objects, we also
    brought up great quantities of rubber incense and rubber objects. The
    early legendary people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> who are supposed to have settled Yucatan were
    called Hulmecas, which means literally ‘rubber people,’ and the name
    was derived from the extensive use of rubber in their religious and
    public rites; just as the Sapotecas, or ‘sapote people,’ are so called
    to this day because of their extensive use of the sapote tree and
    its fruits and derivatives. So says the gifted historian Torquemade,
    following much the same line of reasoning as other writers, who say
    that the name of the tribe called Olmecas was derived from their
    general term or name for their chief or overlord.</p>

  <p>“Whatever the answers to these mooted questions of etymology may be,
    it has become evident, from the finds brought up from the Sacred Well,
    that the Mayas were users of rubber in various ingenious ways. Many
    of the masses of copal which I raised from the well bore, imbedded
    at or near the surface, nodules or small cylinders of rubber, and in
    some cases wooden splinters still protruded from the rubber insets.
    Obviously both the splinters and the rubber portions were intended as
    lighters for the copal, and this evidence substantiates Torquemade’s
    statement: ‘They light the fires in their vessels containing the copal
    used in their sacrificial ceremonies with rubber.’</p>

  <p>“Upon several of the balls or masses of copal, as found either in their
    original baskets or vases or without their containers, small figures of
    rubber, built around the wooden splinters, were placed in a standing
    position. At times the legs of these little rubber grotesques were half
    buried in the copal. Evidently they were merely more elaborate forms of
    lighters or fuses.</p>

  <p>“One day when the dredge came up with its customary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> load of decayed
    leaves and silt and one of my natives had, as usual, pushed his arms,
    clear to the elbows, into the oozy mass, he leaped back with a cry of
    terror. We all clustered about him to see what was amiss. Silently he
    pointed to the head of a small dark-colored serpent with a white-ringed
    neck, which stood up menacingly from amidst the muck. It was precisely
    of the shape, size, and appearance of a small and extremely poisonous
    viper which is native to Yucatan. Some seconds elapsed before we became
    convinced that it was, after all, made of rubber. Although made by
    hands dead, possibly, ere Christ was born, it turned sinuously in our
    fingers as we drew it from the mud. It has retained the elasticity of
    vulcanized rubber, a substance reinvented by Goodyear in modern times.
    After its centuries of immersion it would surely have shriveled and
    crumpled to bits if it had been long exposed to the air. I took no
    chances, but at once put it in a rubber-preserving fluid.</p>

  <p>“A number of dolls were found, made of wood and adorned with plastic
    copal and rubber. They are perfectly formed and artistically colored
    and decorated. Several have movable arms and legs, with joints made of
    rubber.</p>

  <p>“There was evidence that human nature has not changed—that there
    were cheats and dishonest sharpers then as now. Some of the copal
    balls, instead of being clear, heavy, and pure throughout, as were
    the majority, had a perfect exterior appearance but within were a
    conglomeration of leaves, sticks, and rubbish—evidently the skimming
    or residue from the melting-pot. Doubtless some ancient and not too
    honest profiteer grew wealthy through their fabrication.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

  <p>“Weight for weight, I imagine we accumulated ten times as many
    potsherds as all other specimen material combined. At times a large
    portion of the silt in the dredge seemed to consist of terra-cotta
    grains—an indication of the enormous number of earthenware vessels
    which must have been hurled into the well. Probably for centuries
    the custom was observed of casting into the pool these containers
    filled with burning incense or copal. Very likely some, heated by
    the flaming incense, disintegrated almost at once when they struck
    the cold water, while others lasted for a time and finally crumbled
    into dust. But to furnish all this red-gray mud and burnt earth-silt
    an almost incalculable number of vases and jars and basins must have
    been required. Luckily, by no means all of them were destroyed or even
    broken beyond repair. Scores were saved entirely whole and among them
    are many strange and interesting ones.</p>

  <p>“The range in pattern and workmanship of potsherds is wide. The larger
    vessels or fragments of them—cinerary urns and incense-holders—were
    generally of a coarse, granular biscuit mass, well turned but unevenly
    burned. They are capable, however, of withstanding a considerable
    degree of heat. Between this class and a hard slate-gray ware almost as
    thin and fine as porcelain, are many grades and numerous interesting
    forms, such as well-made models of human heads, manikins, animals,
    reptiles,—especially crocodiles,—grotesque Atlantean figures, and
    tripodal temple vessels used in the sacrificial ceremonies, to hold
    votive offerings or viands.</p>

  <p>“Not always did we have such good fortune in our dredging. At times
    the soft upper layers of mud caved into the pits we had excavated and
    we spent many days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> and weeks in hauling up this mud before we again
    reached the treasure-level.</p>

  <p>“And then, one day, the dredge brought up a perfect skull, bleached
    and polished to whiteness. Examination showed it to be that of a young
    girl. Later came other skulls and human bones, scores of them. Most of
    the skeletons were those of youthful maids, but every now and then one
    was raised which had the breadth of shoulders, the thick skull, and the
    heavy frame of a powerful man—no doubt some mighty warrior sacrificed
    in the flower of his vigor, sent to grace the court of the Rain God.</p>

  <p>“I remember as if it were but yesterday finding in the mud raised by
    the dredge a pair of dainty little sandals, evidently feminine, once
    worn by some graceful, high-born maid. These more than the bleached
    skulls and bones, more than any other of the finds, brought home to
    me the pathos and tragedy of those ancient, well-intentioned, and
    cruelly useless sacrifices. Frequently bits of cotton fabric were
    brought up, perfectly preserved but carbonized. My own theory was, and
    still is, that the copal incense, falling upon the robe of the victim,
    together with the substance with which the body was painted ere it was
    sacrificed, exuded an oil which penetrated the fabric and gradually
    carbonized it, thus preserving it. These specimens of cloth, many of
    which are lovely in design and texture, are, I believe, the only relics
    of ancient Maya fabrics in the world to-day.</p>

  <p>“Detached skeletons were raised until we had upward of ninety, and
    at sight of the whitened bones my heart was wrung with pity for the
    young creatures whose lives had been snuffed out just when living was
    sweetest. Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> finds proved conclusively that the statements made to
    Landa in 1565 by the natives were true—that both maids and warriors
    had been frequently sacrificed to the god of the well.</p>

  <p>“The female skeletons were those of girls ranging in age from fourteen
    to twenty. The first one we raised and completely assembled had a
    small, thin-walled skull, with the sutures almost separate. The
    skull was delicate, shapely, with small, regular, perfect teeth. The
    sympathetic imagination without effort clothed the naked bones with
    flesh and substance, so that one saw instantly the graceful, lovely,
    high-bred maiden and the last solemn act that had stilled the poor
    girlish body, clad in all its finery and left to sink into the ooze at
    the bottom of this terrible pit.</p>

  <p>“By comparing the female skulls with those of modern Mayas, obtained
    from the cemeteries of several villages, I came to the conclusion that
    there was no appreciable variation or difference. These century-old
    skulls might pass as typical crania of pure-blooded young Maya women of
    to-day.</p>

  <p>“The male skulls are a contrast to the female ones. Some are relatively
    large, thick-walled, with protuberant surfaces, receding foreheads, and
    prognathic jaws. Evidently their possessors were ferocious, primitive,
    almost gorilla-like—not of the same race which bred the girl-brides of
    the Rain God. Again this tallies with the tradition that the warriors
    sacrificed were captives—fighting-men of high renown, who, after being
    made drunk with <i lang="myn">bal-che</i> (the sacred mead of the Mayas), were hurled
    into the well as fit offerings to the deity.</p>

  <p>“Some years before the time of which I am speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> I had the good
    fortune to discover in a sealed stone-walled grave the now famous Sabua
    skull. I had to work on it for three days, with atomizer and glue
    water, because the skull, which was perfect in shape, was no more than
    lime-dust which would crumble at the least touch. By this treatment I
    saved it and it is to-day a priceless museum piece kept under glass. In
    view of this experience it seemed strange, almost uncanny, to see these
    perfect skulls and bones come from the well, so wonderfully preserved
    that they required no other treatment than cleansing and rubbing with
    a weak solution of formalin to render them ready for packing and
    shipment. In the Sacred Well, big and gruesome as it is, are no large
    reptiles, no saurians, no fish which would or could tear apart a human
    body or gnaw or crush the bones. I know this to be true, in spite of
    the local traditions which speak of huge serpents and strange animals
    to be seen about the well and to be unpleasantly encountered should one
    be so foolish as to roam about in its vicinity at midnight. I have been
    that foolish many times and have never met anything of the sort. On the
    contrary, in the glorious moonlight of Yucatan the big pool has for me
    an even greater lure than it has in the sunlight.</p>

  <p>“As the excavations in the well became deeper and deeper we passed
    from mud to powdered limestone, which became more and more compact
    until we reached a marl-like bed into which the steel-lipped bucket bit
    with difficulty, finally making almost no impression at all. It became
    obvious that, although we had by no means dredged the whole well,
    we had literally reached the end of our rope as far as dredging was
    concerned. I was convinced that further work of the sort would bring us
    many more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> finds, but I was quite as certain that they would not differ
    greatly in character or variety from those already accumulated.</p>

  <p>“I could not quarrel with our good fortune thus far. I felt well
    repaid, even if we should discover nothing else, for all my effort and
    expense. My highly speculative venture had amply justified itself.
    I had proved conclusively the history of the Sacred Well. But our
    dredging operations, together with soundings made from time to time,
    indicated clearly that the bottom of the well was very uneven—a series
    of hummocks; almost a miniature mountain range. And in the pockets
    between those hummocks, where our dredge could not reach, might there
    not be other treasures?—objects heavier and smaller in size than
    anything we had yet found; things which, because of their weight, would
    sink through the mud to the very bottom of the well.</p>

  <p>“Never could I leave the spot until, by some means or other, this last
    and final ghost was laid.”</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
      <span class="small">SIXTY FEET UNDER WATER</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WE had reached the stage where it was very slow work for the dredge to
    get even a mouthful of the stiff, almost shale-like bottom of the well,
    but, while we brought up fewer treasures than previously, I was not
    ready to discard the derrick and dredge as long as the bucket brought
    up any finds whatever.</p>

  <p>“To facilitate the work at this stage, a plan which I had long
    considered was put into effect. We built a big flat-bottomed scow,
    crude but serviceable, and capable of holding ten scoopfuls of muck
    from the dredge. The scow was constructed, right on the brink of the
    well, of logs and such other materials as we had at hand. Then we
    lowered it, by means of the derrick, until it floated easily seventy
    feet below, on the still surface of the water.</p>

  <p>“I fancy if the grim old Rain God, Noh-och Yum Chac, the Indra of
    the Mayas, was enraged when the dredge first began to rob him of his
    long-held treasures, the presence of this clumsy craft, as it tipped
    and yawed on its slow seventy-foot descent to the water, must surely
    have excited him to frenzy. Yet inexorably we continued our quest,
    undaunted by the thought of the god’s wrath and determined to strip him
    of every secret. We moored the craft, by a long rope, to a projecting
    stone knob on the sheer wall of the well, so that it was directly over
    the area where the dredge had been working. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>Our system was to lower
    the bucket, raise it, and pour its dripping contents upon the scow, and
    this we continued to do until we had heaped upon the boat ten buckets
    of bottom mud. Loaded to its capacity, the scow was drawn to a narrow
    sandy shelf or beach which had formed at one side of the well. Then we
    transferred and examined the load, handling ten buckets from the dredge
    in about the same length of time it had taken us previously to dispose
    of one. And thus, for a while, the dredge was made to work profitably
    even under the increasing scarcity of ‘pay dirt.’</p>

  <p>“During this phase of our labor we accumulated a great quantity of
    potsherds, copal, and rubber nodules. Each time the filled scow came
    to the little beach, the big toads retreated into their rocky cavities
    amidst the roots and the myriad eyes that usually shone in these
    twilight depths became invisible. Only the iguanas and the lizards in
    the branches of the cork-trees that shadowed the tiny beach remained
    sleepily undisturbed, while the little painted tortoises on the
    half-submerged logs or branches floating near by became so accustomed
    to the sight of the scow that they stayed brazenly in their places and
    eyed the proceedings without fear.</p>

  <p>“As the work went on, the tailing or discard from our dredge began
    to spread out and extend our little beach until it became a solid
    peninsula jutting out into the well and making our labors easier by
    providing much-needed footing and elbow-room.</p>

  <p>“Long hours I spent gazing over the side of the scow, waiting for
    the dredge to come up with its load, and while I waited I glimpsed
    fascinating highlights of a hitherto unknown world—a world with its
    tragedies, grotesqueries, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>and surprises; a world in which humans
    took no part; one unseen until then by human eyes. Drifting past on
    the turgid waters were curious jelly-like formless creatures and tiny
    water-insects, some moving slowly as with effort, others like an arrow
    in shape and speed. Here was a plethora of twisting, darting, gyrating
    forms of life, all intent on the one object of preserving life—that
    bitter jest of Nature who instils in us each, great or small, the
    belief that our own particular and individual existence is of amazing
    import when she herself values it so lightly.</p>

  <p>“Floating on the water were many small red worms no larger round than
    a pin and perhaps a quarter of an inch long. As one floated lazily by,
    a small red ant, blown or fallen from the land above, struck the water
    and instantly was attacked by the worm. The struggle was titanic but
    brief and the worm, which was more slender than its victim, simply
    swallowed the ant—body, struggling legs, and all. As the swallowing
    continued the body of the worm became almost transparent and I could
    easily follow the journey of his dinner inside, until diner and dinner
    drifted out of sight.</p>

  <p>“Close by the cliff-like wall of the pool was a school of tiny
    jet-black catfish—pouts, we used to call them in New England when
    I was a lad. They were but a few days beyond the egg state and were
    carefully herded by a portly, motherly old catfish. Her inclination
    evidently was toward dignified, unhurried movement, well tempered with
    complete repose, but the erratic and swift excursions of her hundred
    or more infants kept her on the qui vive to head off their ceaseless
    turnings and dashes, for they seemed possessed to venture into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
    outer and unknown world, even as other infants since time began. To add
    to her trials, the whole school was more or less surrounded by tadpoles
    just as black and even more lively than the baby fishes. They seemed
    not to have nor to require any motherly care and, like impudent street
    gamins, they delighted in teasing and leading astray the more tenderly
    nurtured youngsters. Slyly they tried to swallow the little fishes,
    tail first, in their sucker-like mouths, and were dissuaded only by the
    wrathful dash of Mother Catfish.</p>

  <p>“It was during this time, which I call the intermediate stage of the
    work, that many of our specimens of lighter weight were obtained. Among
    them are pieces of gourds, copal fragments, parts of wooden objects,
    and bones, all wonderfully preserved in this colossal silo—for the
    Sacred Well is in many respects like a silo. Some of the potsherds and
    wooden objects, and even a few of the gourds, had been covered with a
    thick white paint, almost as hard as enamel, and upon the surface of
    this the artists of old had worked and drawn figures and hieroglyphs
    similar to those found in the Codices. Some of the finest pieces of
    ancient fabrics were recovered at this time. The gradual caving in of
    the mud about the cavity we had scooped out permitted these fabrics to
    slip gently into the hole and to be brought up unharmed by the steel
    lips of our dredge. They are all carefully preserved and are the only
    authentic specimens of their kind known to archæological science. I
    deem them among the most important of my treasures from the well.</p>

  <p>“There came up ropes and cords, both of bark and fiber, and curiously
    knotted masses of copal; images carved from light wood and covered with
    rubber and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> copal; and always bones and more bones, of maidens and
    warriors.</p>

  <p>“At last the dredge bit only on rock and boulders, against which the
    steel jaws made no headway. Again and again the bucket came up empty
    and with its jaws twisted and bent.</p>

  <p>“If the first stage—the beginning of the work, when the steel bucket
    first plunged into the still water of the pit—was exciting, I found
    myself now laboring under a still greater emotion, for the time had
    come which I had long foreseen, when the dredge unaided by human hands
    could accomplish nothing more. There must be hands at the bottom of the
    well—not the dead hands of pitiful maidens, but live hands of sturdy
    men to explore every inch of the uneven rocky bottom. From dredging
    with windlass and bucket, we must pass to a season of deep-sea diving
    with all the paraphernalia of diving-suits and hose and air-pumps.</p>

  <p>“What could be more interesting, more romantic than to go down under
    sixty feet of water to the very bottom of this grim pit?—to tread
    the corridors of the most sacred and abysmal abode of the Rain God?
    I might possibly remain at the bottom, myself, a modern sacrifice to
    the ancient deity, but I was willing to take that chance; for nothing
    could now keep from the world the treasures already recovered from the
    well and if I perished in the attempt at further discoveries, my effort
    would be, as a whole, not in vain. It was almost like trying to push
    aside the veil that separates living man from the nether world. Who
    might say but that the ancient people spoke the truth when they said
    that the entrance to the habitation of the Rain God was guarded by
    huge serpents and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> that none might pass but those expressly summoned
    by the god, to carry out his mandates? Or might there not live in that
    deep ooze slimy-bodied monsters of the antediluvian era, to which the
    passing of the centuries was but as the passing of hours? This was
    no time for speculation. I did not crave to serve as a brontosaurian
    breakfast, yet I must know the bottom of this well.</p>

  <p>“Long hours and many days must be spent down on the bed-rock, under
    high water-pressure, in total darkness and in a temperature but little
    above freezing. My hands must explore the cracks and crevices and
    corners and pits where the dredge could not enter, and each find must
    be carried to the bucket and placed carefully within it, to be raised
    later.</p>

  <p>“I went over every detail of the plan with great care, for not only
    my own life but the lives of others depended upon its practicability.
    A hitch, an unforeseen obstacle, a piece of bungling, and one or
    more of us would never return alive to the sunlight. I was prepared
    for this part of the business, having become an experienced deep-sea
    diver back in the United States. But diving under bright skies in open
    water spaces bathed to some depth by clear sunlight reflected from the
    sandy sea-bottom is not at all the same as descending into turgid,
    green, almost opaque water confined by high-cliffed walls overgrown
    with mighty trees and festooned with huge vines twisting and turning
    like giant serpents. I knew it to be very different from and far
    more dangerous than clearing off the barnacles and seaweed from the
    clean-lined bodies of United States cruisers and lighthouse tenders.</p>

  <p>“Early one bright morning my crew who worked the windlass and managed
    the bucket stood grouped about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> the derrick. The winch which had so
    long rattled and clanged as the steel jaws of the dredge opened and
    plunged down to their task, was silent and motionless; but its silence,
    like that of the men grouped about, seemed to be a sort of watchful
    waiting rather than the lazy inertia that comes with a holiday hiatus.
    The cogged wheels were hooked introspectively, as it were, but the
    jaws of the bucket hung loosely open like those of a school-boy, agape
    with interest and wonder. On the refuse-built level space between the
    derrick and the examination platforms were strewn strange-looking suits
    of armor, canvas-lined and metal-covered, piles of rope and rubber
    hose, canvas-covered rope ladders, a small but powerful air-pump, and
    divers other things. Yes, even the divers themselves, for he who was
    to be my aide in this undertaking had come under contract from the
    sponge-banks of Florida with his striker, or pump attendant, and all
    the necessary equipment. Both men were Greeks, young, lithe, handsome
    as Apollo himself. All that day we spent assembling, testing, and
    getting everything ready for actual diving operations early the next
    morning. As fast as the apparatus was put in order we placed it on the
    scow, which had been scoured and cleaned and was now transformed into
    an ideal diver’s craft. Before nightfall the air-pump was securely
    fixed on the scow, the air-tubes and life-lines were in place, and the
    rope ladder dangled over the side and disappeared into the green water.
    From its bottom rung I should, on the morrow, step off into the unknown.</p>

  <p>“The morning of the next day was heavy with clouds that soon broke in
    a deluge—a three-day norther that kept us all under cover except for
    a diurnal excursion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> when the Greeks and I and my native striker went
    to the edge of the well and from there carefully scanned the scow to
    make sure our equipment was weathering the storm. Luckily, the entire
    apparatus, pump and all, was almost amphibious by nature and habit, and
    so far as the eye could see the wetting was doing no damage.</p>

  <p>“Dawn of the fourth day was clear and bright and the leaves and grass,
    even the sky, seemed to have been washed clean by the long rain. After
    a hasty breakfast we hurried to the well and descended via the air
    route, in the dredge bucket, to the rain-soaked, water-covered deck
    of the scow. We bailed out the water and sponged off the deck, on
    which we then laid out with minute care the two rubber-lined canvas
    diving-suits, making sure that there were no holes through which
    the compressed air could issue in lines of silver bubbles into the
    surrounding water. Our wrists were carefully soaped and we stepped
    into the clumsy uniforms, forcing our hands through the tight-fitting
    rubber wristlets. The neck-bands were adjusted and the copper helmets,
    cloth-lined and with glassed goggle eyes, were put over our heads and
    securely fastened. Then came a necklace of lead plates and finally
    heavy metal-soled boots.</p>

  <p>“A trial puff of air from the pump, a touch of the valves in the
    helmets, and we were ready to call on Noh-och Yum Chac at the bottom of
    the Sacred Well. With a final hand-clasp all around and with my Indians
    looking very awed and solemn, I waddled to the edge of the craft and
    clambered down the rope ladder about as gracefully as a turtle falling
    off a log.</p>

  <p>“I must confess that as I loosed my hold of the last rung and went
    swirling down into the watery darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> my heart beat far faster than
    could be reasonably accounted for by the increasing water-pressure;
    and my mind, like that of a drowning person, reviewed at lightning
    speed all the errors of commission and omission of my whole life. But
    almost automatically I took the precautions of every experienced diver,
    making sure that the air-line and life-line were free and clear of
    obstacles. Almost at once the weak, greenish light faded into utter
    blackness. Once or twice during the descent my lines brushed against
    some sunken tree roots or branches and I was instantly alert, for in
    such encounters there is always an element of real danger. These woody
    projections were, however, quite rotten and with no more strength than
    soaked punk, and fortunately always broke off at the mere touch of the
    stout rope.</p>

  <p>“Meanwhile, as I went down and down, at a distance of every ten feet or
    so I felt acute pains in my ears, as though sharp objects were being
    thrust into them. By adjusting the valves in the helmet and opening
    wide my mouth, I succeeded in equalizing the air-pressure on the ears,
    causing a sound like the exhaust of a motorcycle on the ear-drums but
    relieving the pain. Once I was at the bottom, the helmet valves alone
    required attention; for only by opening them frequently is fresh air
    forced down from the pump and the vitiated air expelled.</p>

  <p>“I had reached the bottom but a moment before I sensed that the Greek
    diver had also descended and was close beside me. He had waited only
    long enough, before joining me, to make sure my native pump attendant
    was handling my air-supply properly. The darkness was complete, a
    perfect blindfold, but I reached out and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> touched the Greek so that we
    might be sure of our relative locations and not get our lines entangled.</p>

  <p>“Standing upon the uneven, rocky bottom of the well, I was thrilled
    with the knowledge that I stood where no living man had stood since
    time began. I think I felt much the same high elation that must have
    filled Peary and Shackleton at the end of their respective dashes to
    the polar caps.</p>

  <p>“I had foreseen the need of light and had provided myself with the
    very latest and best submarine electric light obtainable. What any
    illuminant could do, this light would do. But what light can force its
    beams through a lake of chocolate-colored porridge? Our lights were of
    not the slightest use in this grim old water-pit and we had to depend
    entirely upon the sense of touch. And this sense served us well, for
    under constant use our finger-tips grew highly sensitive. The palpi in
    the skin whorls and curves became so responsive that we were frequently
    able to distinguish the form and texture of the objects we touched and
    even got so far as to guess at colors, although we made many wrong
    hazards.</p>

  <p>“Another modern invention which we carried at the bottom of the
    well was the submarine telephone. It operated satisfactorily, but
    we found little use for it, as it was less bothersome merely to
    give the required number of tugs on the signal rope when we wanted
    to communicate with those above. The Greek and I found also that by
    touching the metal fronts of our helmets we could converse easily with
    each other. The voice tones were muffled, but with a little practice we
    had no trouble in understanding each other. I even recollect hearing
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> chattering of the strong white teeth of my Hellenic companion. The
    water was very cold and every time we came to the surface after our
    daily two hours of immersion our lips were blue and our bodies covered
    with goose-flesh and trembling with chill. Coffee, very hot and very
    strong, was our first requisite.</p>

  <p>“The water-pressure at a depth of sixty feet is considerable, and
    both the air-tubes and life-lines were buoyed in several places by
    tightly corked quart bottles. When drawn up after the day’s work, the
    lower ones were always half full of water, in spite of the fact that
    the empty bottles had been corked as tightly as possible before being
    lowered into the water. This will give some idea of the tremendous
    pressure.</p>

  <p>“This pressure, offset by a corresponding pressure of air in the
    diving-suit, affects in a peculiar manner the movements of the diver.
    In spite of my necklace of leaden plates and my two-inch lead soles,
    I seemed to weigh nothing at all. A slight stamp of my foot upon the
    bottom would take me soaring upward perhaps ten feet in the water,
    and I would then come slowly down to rest two yards from my original
    position. It took good judgment to land in any precise spot, because
    it was so very easy to overshoot the mark. It seemed as though one
    real leap would carry me clear to the surface of the well and perhaps
    entirely up the cliff-like sides.</p>

  <p>“On one occasion I became so interested in the finds on the bottom
    of the well that I quite forgot to let out the accumulated air by
    means of the helmet valves. I had been working diligently, feeling
    along the silt-filled cracks of the rocky bottom; then, satisfied
    with my examination, I gave a stamp of my foot and started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> upward.
    But my diving-suit was so filled with compressed air that I turned in
    the water topsyturvy and finally hit the bottom of the scow feet up,
    with a resounding thump of my metal soles which almost caused a panic
    among the natives on the deck of the craft. Meanwhile I swung around
    turtle-wise from under the boat, found the rope ladder, and started to
    climb over the side. My henchmen, pallid with fear, were pumping for
    dear life, while I, at the side of the boat but below their line of
    vision, opened wide the helmet valves to prevent them from blowing me
    up like a toy balloon. When I appeared over the side they all crowded
    around me and Juan Mis, my faithful old servant, took my helmet-encased
    head in both his hands and peered eagerly through the thick glass
    insets. ‘God be praised, he is laughing!’ shouted Juan, and they all
    chuckled with happy relief, while I sat on the gunwale and was divested
    of my cumbersome habiliments.</p>

  <p>“Our first task was to discover the nature of the stone objects that
    had so often cramped the jaws of our dredge and strained its chains,
    costing us hours of hard work in repairs. The fact that the dredge
    had never secured a sufficient purchase on any of these stones to
    bring them to the surface led me to surmise that the majority were
    smooth-faced and probably hieroglyphed. Mere rocks or boulders rarely
    were so smooth that the steel bucket could not grip them and bring them
    up after a trial or two.</p>

  <p>“By feeling over the bottom of the well with my hands, I located the
    stones one after another and found my surmise correct. We managed to
    fasten chains about them and by means of the derrick raised them from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
    their watery bed. One by one the heavy, wondrously carved stones were
    hauled up through sixty feet of water and up another seventy feet until
    they rested upon the brink of the well. One great stone was a perfectly
    sculptured statue of a seated god or priest which reminded me of ‘The
    Thinker,’ by Rodin.</p>

  <p>“The next day we again descended into the well, this time not in search
    of large objects such as carved stones, but rather in quest of small
    things lying in the silt between the humps and in the crevices at the
    bottom.</p>

  <p>“I remember distinctly my sensations as my fingers touched upon curious
    small objects like coins, small nuts, and rings. I could hardly
    contain my curiosity as I tucked them into my pouch, and my eagerness
    to get up to light and air to examine them was almost irresistible.
    When I had collected perhaps twenty or thirty I gave the signal and
    started upward. Before my diving-dress had been more than half removed
    I plunged my chilled fingers into the dripping pouch and drew out
    beautiful embossed rings, small bells of copper, and several bells
    of pure gold. There were bells and ornaments and medallions of gold
    repoussé and gold filagree, of exquisite design and craftmanship. There
    were lovely carved jade beads and other objects of jade. Just as truly
    as any mining prospector, I had struck gold, but gold tremendously
    more valuable than his raw nuggets; for, whatever might be the mere
    intrinsic value of my golden finds, each bit was in reality beyond
    price.</p>

  <p>“This was but the beginning. We now had at our command two means of
    bringing up the treasure. The big carved stones having been removed
    from the well, the dredge could again be used, or we could don the
    diving-suits. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>In many instances the Greek and I directed from the
    bottom the work of the dredge. The golden objects brought up, if simply
    thrown into the goldsmith’s melting-pot, would net several hundreds
    of thousands of dollars in bullion—dividend enough, if one were
    sufficiently sordid of mind, to justify all my investment of time,
    effort, and money in the undertaking.</p>

  <p>“One particularly wet and dreary day the dredge had worked all morning
    long, in a monotonous round in which nothing of value was brought
    up. Toward lunch-time I had about decided to send the men to their
    quarters for the rest of the day, to let them recover from their
    half-drowned state. Just then the men at the receiving-platform gave
    a shout that brought me running. For several blissful minutes we were
    busy picking lovely little copper bells from the black ooze. The rain
    was forgotten. Bearers were sent to bring our lunch, and eagerly we
    sent the steel bucket down again. And again it came up with a pudding
    of mud plentifully plummed with copper bells. All afternoon we plied
    the dredge, and nearly every load contained more copper bells, of all
    sizes and shapes, none larger than our old-fashioned sleigh-bells and
    many much smaller. In fact, they so resembled sleigh-bells that I could
    not rid my mind of the idea that they were modern bells used for barter
    and exchange, like the hawks’ bells of Spain. At the end of the day
    we had piled up over two hundred of these curious specimens of Maya
    workmanship, and even the most cursory examination showed them to be of
    genuine ancient origin.</p>

  <p>“We carried the bells to the plantation house, where all the servants
    looked with awe and wonder at <i lang="es">los cascabeles de los antiguos</i>,
    the bells of the ancient people. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> that time on hardly a day
    passed that we did not add a handful of copper bells to our growing
    collection. The bells are mainly capsule-shaped or spherical. Some
    still have a carbon core within, showing clearly the method by which
    they were molded. Very rarely did the bells contain clappers or
    rattles, and this fact supports the tradition that the ancient people
    believed that all things had life and souls. By removal of the clappers
    the bells were ‘killed,’ made mute forever, and their souls, thus
    released, entered the realm of Ah Puch, the God of Death. Incidentally,
    the portraits of Ah Puch show him with anklets of bells.</p>

  <p>“Certain of the larger copper bells have rope-like designs embossed
    on them, while others are fashioned like animals and birds and the
    grinning heads of Cheshire cats. Some represent the heads of foxes or
    of the anteater, showing unmistakably the long, tapering snout.</p>

  <p>“Intermingled with the bells were copper circlets like finger rings,
    and curious flat copper ferrules, from a fourth to three quarters of an
    inch thick and about an inch long.</p>

  <p>“One day we brought up a handful of small masks, about an inch long
    and half an inch wide, made of thin, well-worked copper. By a strange
    coincidence they came to us on the very day of a modern native carnival
    when every one wears a mask. My Indians commented upon the fact and
    seriously debated whether Yum Chac had not sent them up to us in
    remembrance of the day. And it is a fact that no other masks of the
    kind were found previously, nor have any been found since.</p>

  <p>“Specimens of well-modeled hard copper chisels were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> recovered at
    various times. Some are small, others of the customary size and shape
    of modern chisels, but with the heads burred, showing much use. All of
    the copper chisels, rings, and masks have the reddish color of pure
    copper, but many of the bells, particularly the smaller ones of round
    sleigh-bell shape, are of a color indicating copper alloyed with silver
    or tin. Some of the other bells contain a considerable percentage of
    gold, which may be either a natural admixture from the ore itself or an
    alloy added by the ancient artisans.</p>

  <p>“One of the most prized treasures was brought up one day while visitors
    were present—Mr. and Mrs. James of Mérida and Dr. Marston Tozzer, now
    professor of American archæology at Harvard University, who knows the
    Mayas intimately and has lived among them and shared their huts and
    hammocks. We were all standing at the edge of the Great Well when the
    dredge bucket heaved itself from the roiling swells of green water. As
    it came up toward the level of our eyes we saw dangling precariously
    from one of its fangs a gray, nondescript article which some one in the
    party facetiously remarked must be a cast-off overshoe of the Rain God.
    We all laughed at the witticism and then stopped short as the bucket
    swung around, bringing the object into plainer view, and we discovered
    it be a large copper disk covered with figures in repoussé and
    representing the Sun God. My heart was in my mouth for fear it would
    drop off and sink back into the well before my eager hands could reach
    it, but grasp it I did after what seemed an age of waiting. It is so
    beautifully and intricately worked, so fine in artistry that I deem it
    one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> of the most priceless of all these antiques. What it loses by not
    being pure gold is more than compensated for by its mass of exquisite
    ornamentation.</p>

  <p>“From copper to gold, so John Hays Hammond once told me, is but a short
    step and one likely to be bridged at any unexpected moment, and this I
    found to be the case in the Sacred Well.</p>

  <p>“One fine day I discovered, among the several copper bells brought up
    by the dredge, one small round bell of pure gold, shining as bright and
    clear as if newly molded. After that every day was literally a golden
    day with finds of yellow gold—golden bells of all shapes and sizes,
    some as small as a pea, others large and heavy. And these gold bells
    were all more or less flattened, as though they had been struck with a
    hammer or even mauled with a sledge. Some were so flattened that the
    shape of the clapper within was outlined on the outer side of the bell.
    The clappers were, like the bells themselves, made of pure gold, but
    most of the smaller bells, like our previous finds of copper ones, had
    been ‘killed’ by having the clapper removed.</p>

  <p>“Many disks of gold were brought up, which are covered with finely
    worked figures in repoussé, while around the outer edges are characters
    and symbols and sometimes hieroglyphs. Some of these disks were
    originally flat and others have curving surfaces like breastplates. A
    few are plain or nearly so, but the majority are completely covered
    with incised work. One disk, a mask, is two thirds the actual size
    of a human face and represents a face with the eyes closed. Upon the
    closed eyelid is engraved a symbol of unknown meaning. Another disk of
    solid gold is eleven inches in diameter and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> weighs nearly a pound. It
    contains no carving or design and I judge it to have been some sort of
    temple basin or standard.</p>

  <p>“Among the golden objects are two very handsome tiaras representing
    entwined feathered serpents, worked partly in repoussé and partly in
    filagree. There are also a number of emblematic figures, dancing frogs
    and monkeys, and several queer objects like brooches. They are from one
    to three inches high and very thick. There are objects like sandals
    and objects similar to candlesticks. Some of the latter are of copper,
    gold-plated. I found, too, a considerable amount of gold-leaf nearly as
    fine and pure as that of to-day.</p>

  <p>“Also among the golden treasures are several specimens that look like
    the heads of canes. These I believe to have been the tops of the
    official wands or emblems of authority—the <i lang="myn">caluac</i> pictured many
    times upon the walls of the temples.</p>

  <p>“I found virtually no silver and no metals other than those mentioned,
    except iron pyrites. This substance, backed with hard-baked clay or
    stone, was used for mirrors, and I found large fragments of several
    such mirrors with the mirror surface of iron pyrites still bright and
    shiny. One metal object about three inches in diameter is white like
    silver, absolutely uncorroded, and seemingly as hard and refractory as
    tin alloy or hard steel. I do not know yet what the metal is, but shall
    know as soon as it can be examined by metallurgists. Can it be that
    rare, indestructible metal, platinum?</p>

  <p>“And with all the precious objects I have taken by force from the Rain
    God I am very sure that I have wrested from him not a tenth of his
    jealously held treasure. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>There are many, many more golden ornaments
    hid away in the recesses of the uneven floor of the pit, and many, many
    things even more priceless than gold to the antiquarian.</p>

  <p>“All this I leave to the engineer of a future day—and I say engineer
    advisedly, for it is going to be an engineering task to strip the
    old well of all it holds. It will first have to be dredged over its
    whole area, not with the crude hand-operated device which I have used,
    but with more powerful and modern, mechanically operated equipment.
    Then a huge, specially designed diving-bell will be required, so that
    men may work under it quite protected from the water and with ample
    illumination.</p>

  <p>“Among the treasures we found are three sacrificial knives. One is
    perfect, while the flint blades of the other two are broken close
    to the hilt. I am inclined to think that the two broken ones were
    purposely broken or ‘killed’ before being thrown into the well and that
    the perfect one was not cast into the pit but fell in by accident.
    These knives have intricately worked and fluted handles of gold. The
    one which is unbroken is especially lovely—a bit of perfect artistry
    worthy of a Cellini.</p>

  <p>“One golden bowl is nine inches in diameter, and we obtained several
    smaller ones about three inches in diameter. These, I think, were
    temple dishes used by the high priests. The several gold disks of the
    Sun God vary from seven to eleven inches in diameter. And we recovered
    forty flat gold washers about an inch and a fourth in diameter, each
    with a hole in the center. Regarding the use to which they were put
    I have no clue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> and can only surmise that they were fastened to the
    garments of priests or of sacrificial victims.</p>

  <p>“The several brooches, as indicated by the designs upon them, were used
    for personal adornment. The finger rings are peculiar in that they
    have an enlarged face like a signet-ring, but the enlarged portion is
    designed to fit at the side of the finger, rather than on top, and this
    enlarged part always contains a pictured face.</p>

  <p>“There are many golden figures of animals and insects, the most
    interesting being frogs with exaggerated flat feet, such as are found
    in the graves of Puerto Rico. Among the great quantity of other
    articles, too numerous to describe here, are twelve plain disks of gold
    which I imagine are blanks, originally intended by the goldsmith for
    some craftsman to ornament with designs, but for some reason or other
    thrown into the Sacred Well in their uncompleted state.</p>

  <p>“Many of the larger golden objects, apparently, were not ‘killed’
    before being offered to the Rain God, but nearly all the smaller
    articles of gold were crushed. Most of these have since been
    painstakingly straightened into their original shapes.</p>

  <p>“Of the pottery vessels, very few were recovered unbroken. Some, as I
    have said, were containers for copal and rubber incense. Others, I am
    led to believe, contained the ancient libation of <i lang="myn">bal-che</i> or sacred
    mead which was thrown into the pool together with the captive warrior
    victims. This fermented drink made of rainwater, wild honey, and the
    bark of the <i lang="myn">yax</i> tree, according to tradition, was for men only. Women
    were never permitted to taste it nor to be present at the ceremonies
    where it was used as a libation to the gods. The narrow-necked <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>vessel
    in which it was contained was called a <em>pool</em> and had a flat clay
    stopper fastened to the neck with cords of bark. We brought up several
    of the necks of such containers with the stoppers still held in the
    orifices by the bark binding.</p>

  <p>“Several of the open vessels with tripod legs are glazed with red
    inside and out; others have a blue lining, and many were red on the
    outer surface but left the natural clay color upon the inside. The legs
    were either rounded and hollow, containing rattle pellets, or thin and
    solid. They are often fashioned as the heads of alligators or as human
    grotesques. Many large flat vessels and shallow circular dishes, some
    nine inches in diameter, were found, of the same design and finish as
    those I have unearthed in ancient graves in Labna and other old Maya
    cities.</p>

  <p>“The ancient devotees seem to have been especially partial to a certain
    cylindrical vessel about six inches in diameter and nine inches high.
    These were often of thin structure and covered with designs and
    hieroglyphs or bearing the outlined figures of some deity surrounded
    with the conventional symbols of his attributes.</p>

  <p>“A large circular earthenware pan, seven inches in diameter and with
    a long, thick handle which frequently ended in a carved head, was in
    common use as an incense-burner. It was rarely made of well-kilned
    ware and was evidently intended only for brief service. We found many
    broken utensils of this sort, but only one perfect specimen, which
    is exceptional in that it is of better-kilned material and of most
    artistic workmanship. Its pleasing outline is ornamented with openwork
    spaces intended <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>to give needed draft to the burning copal in its
    basin. Nearly all the incense-burners of this type have hollow legs
    containing burned clay pellets evidently designed to produce a rattling
    sound at religious dances and rituals.</p>

  <p>“The mortuary urns are large vessels ornamented with the likeness of a
    human figure surrounded with a conventional design. The figure usually
    bears upon its back a vase-like receptacle doubtless designed to
    receive and preserve the ashes of the dead. I do not know whether these
    urns were empty when thrown into the well or actually contained human
    ashes. I hope this point may be settled by laboratory examination.</p>

  <p>“The finding of copal and the intimate association of the copal masses
    with the potsherds and unbroken earthenware vessels, leaves no doubt
    as to the use and purpose of both. The employment of copal resin as
    a medicament and as a sacred offering seems to have occurred almost
    simultaneously with the appearance of man upon the peninsula of
    Yucatan. In the primitive rock sculptures in the famous cave of Loltum
    is shown the burning of copal as a religious rite, while the earthen
    vessels found in the cave contain the blackened residue of burnt
    copal—a residue that, despite its antiquity and long inhumation, gives
    forth, when burned, the characteristic odor of copal resin, a fragrance
    not to be mistaken for any other. The copal tree, anciently known as
    <i lang="myn">psom</i>, still grows sparsely in nearly every part of Yucatan and in
    ancient times it was carefully cultivated, while the gathering of the
    resin partook of the nature of a religious ceremony. One of the early
    Spanish chroniclers says:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i lang="myn">Psom</i> is the name of a tree from which the natives take out a
      certain kind of resin-like incense which they burn before their
      idols and in their houses. We Spaniards took advantage of this
      resin to cure many diseases and we called it copal, which is a
      Mexican word.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“The first piece of copal we found was nearly round and about the size
    of a baseball. The resin when fresh is light in weight and almost
    transparent, but time and the pressure of water at the bottom of the
    well have given our copal specimens the general lack-luster appearance
    of the bog-butter found in the lacustrine deposits of Switzerland.
    Several hundreds of these copal masses were brought up in round or oval
    form and many with the marks on them of wicker containers or baskets.
    One of the largest of these copal specimens, weighing several pounds,
    was thus incased, some portions of the basket fabric still clinging to
    the copal. Evidently the copal was still plastic when placed in the
    baskets. A number of the copal nodules had been wrapped in leaves, the
    veined imprint of which upon the copal surface is so clear that I doubt
    not that any good botanist would be able to identify the tree or vine
    from which they were plucked.</p>

  <p>“Quantities of bark were brought up which have upon the inner surface
    pellets of copal arranged in the conventional symbol or prayer for
    rain. Several of the copal masses are molded in the semblance of human
    figures or faces, many of them fantastic or grotesque. Many are in the
    form of frogs and some of these frogs hold a small ball of rubber in
    their mouths.</p>

  <p>“Gourds of all kinds we brought up—small tree gourds which broke even
    under the most careful handling and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> which were preserved with the
    utmost difficulty; <i lang="myn">leks</i> or big gourds, some measuring a foot across
    and with a two-gallon capacity; gourds cracked and mended with bark
    lacing, just as they are still mended and used by the Mayas of to-day;
    gourds coated with the same whitish enamel used on terra-cotta vessels
    and painted or hieroglyphed. The gourds were undoubtedly used not only
    as containers for liquids but for other things such as corn and beans,
    as they are used by the modern Mayas. None of these gourds was found
    with a top or stopper in it, but we brought up separately many of the
    top sections which had been removed to permit the hollowing out of the
    gourd. Some still had an inch or two of stem left on them purposely
    to provide a handle and were undoubtedly used as covers or stoppers.
    Possibly some of these gourds with their contents of food or drink were
    originally sealed before being cast into the well.</p>

  <p>“Among the wooden objects, the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>, which I have previously
    described, is the most interesting, and our finds in the well represent
    the whole history of the development of this weapon, from its most
    primitive bill-hook appearance to its most finished and ornamented
    ceremonial form.</p>

  <p>“The highest stage in the development of the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i> is represented
    by two specimens from the well. One represents an entwined serpent, its
    fangs at the hook; in its now hollow eye-sockets probably were once
    glittering eyeballs of jade. The shaft of the second specimen is formed
    of human figures and is fronted with a fine mosaic or mask of burnished
    gold. The whole weapon is as elaborately and minutely carved and
    inlaid as the finest example of Japanese wood-carving. And we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> found
    the stone-headed darts which were used with the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>. They are
    pictured clearly on the walls of the temples, but an actual dart or any
    part of one had never been found before we raised our specimens from
    the well. Any one may now view them in the Peabody Museum at Harvard
    University—some without the stone heads but showing the cleft in the
    wooden shaft into which the head was fitted. There are also several of
    the sharp stone dart-heads, made of common chert and flint. A few are
    beautifully formed and fashioned of translucent chalcedony, jasper, and
    even jade. These specimens represent the highest known development of
    ancient stone point-work of the American continents and probably of the
    whole world.</p>

  <p>“Portions of lance-poles were found, and stone lance-points. Some of
    these, like the beautiful dart-points, still carry traces of the hard
    black bitumen—possibly hardened copal—that once fastened the stone
    point to its wooden shaft.</p>

  <p>“Wooden objects shaped like the incisors of a jaguar and bearing
    fragments of handsome mosaics encrusted on them are probably parts of
    what were once jaguar head-masks. Other similar objects are plated with
    gold—portions of golden jaguar-masks. Parts of large trough-shaped
    wooden objects are doubtless the remnants of shields. The wood is
    Yucatan cedar, light and easily worked, yet resistant to the destroying
    effect of weather and insects. All of the wooden objects required quick
    and skilful application of preservatives, for, while they had about
    the consistency of wet punk when they came from the water, even a few
    moments’ exposure to the air would have been sufficient to crumble them
    into dust.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> Happily, I was fully prepared for this contingency, and not
    a single important wooden find was lost or injured for lack of proper
    treatment.</p>

  <p>“Next to the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>, the most important of the wooden treasures is
    the <i lang="myn">caluac</i>, the wand, scepter, or symbolic badge of high priesthood
    or nobility. Many times upon the temple walls are pictured dignitaries
    holding this device, as a king might hold a scepter or a bishop his
    crook. The general form is that of a forked rabbit-stick. It may be
    significant that the figure portrayed carrying the <i lang="myn">caluac</i> is never
    depicted as carrying also the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>, and perhaps the <i lang="myn">caluac</i> may
    be a ceremonial weapon, symbolic substitute for the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>. Whatever
    its purpose, we have several specimens. Some are nearly perfect and
    there are several sizes. The most common of these finds is about half
    an inch thick by three inches wide and twenty-four inches long.</p>

  <p>“In addition to the wooden dolls and figures I have previously
    mentioned, I obtained a curious ritual rattle inlaid with mosaics, and
    several spatulas somewhat like Japanese praying-sticks. The spatulas
    are thin and about three inches wide by seven in length. Both faces
    show traces of the same hard white enamel found on several of the
    gourds and potsherds. The faint characters on these spatulate wooden
    objects are so precisely like those in the Dresden Codex that one might
    readily believe them the work of the same artist.</p>

  <p>“That phallic rites were practised in some, if not all, sections of the
    peninsula is indicated by a phallus, well carved from hardwood, which
    we brought up from the well. It was recovered from the deeper layers
    of the well-bottom, and this fact precludes any chance that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> is a
    later intrusive artifact. Some distance to the south of El Castillo
    lies a straggling line of large stone phalli, evidently taken from
    some portion of the ruined city by early Spanish settlers and then
    abandoned by the roadside. The House of the Phalli in old Chi-chen Itza
    further emphasizes the fact that the cult here existed and there are
    unmistakable evidences in the ancient ruins of Uxmal.</p>

  <p>“The several wooden labrets, or lip- or cheek-plugs, are of some dark,
    hard wood, possibly <i lang="myn">circicote</i> or ebony. The frontal surface is a
    sunken panel on which is usually carved in relief the figure of a
    plumed warrior. The carving in many cases is as fine as that on the
    best cameos and is brought out by red pigment. Slight traces of green
    are indicated, also, following the same general scheme as the large
    carvings on the temple walls, where green and yellow pigments are used
    to indicate respectively jade and golden objects or ornaments. That
    these colors have withstood centuries of immersion is truly remarkable;
    I doubt much if any of our modern colorings would have the same lasting
    qualities.</p>

  <p>“Now I come to the last and perhaps most important of our
    finds—various objects of jade. We brought up from the very lowest part
    of the well seven jade plaques or tablets, broken but later fitted
    together with almost no parts missing. They measure, approximately,
    three by four inches, and are well carved with cameo-like designs of
    Maya deities. Of similar design and length, but only two inches wide,
    are nine additional plaques.</p>

  <p>“Of jade personal ornaments we recovered a hundred and sixty large,
    handsome carved beads and pendants of varying sizes. These are nearly
    all perfect. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> are seventy carved jade ear, nose, and labret
    ornaments, from two inches in diameter down to half an inch. They are
    all well cut and polished. Among the loveliest specimens are fourteen
    jade globes or balls, an inch and a half in diameter. These are
    beautifully polished and several of them are finely carved with human
    figures and other designs.</p>

  <p>“The most prized of all the jade objects is a figurine four inches wide
    and of like height. It represents a seated figure of the Palenquin
    type, with an elaborate head-dress, and is probably the finest figurine
    of the Maya era which has ever been found. It is of flawless jade,
    perfectly carved and polished, and absolutely unharmed by its centuries
    at the bottom of the well. It alone is worth, a thousand times over,
    the hard years of my life spent in solving the mysteries of the great
    green water-pit whence it came.</p>

  <p>“I have purposely left the mention of the jade finds to the very last,
    for they are the culmination of our discoveries, treasures which,
    instead of enlightening our ignorance, only add another unanswerable
    riddle, another intriguing enigma.</p>

  <p>“These plaques and ornaments, green, gray, or black; this wonderful
    figurine—all are of genuine jade, and jade is simply not indigenous
    in America. Despite all seeking and all investigation, not one single
    outcropping vein of jade has been found on the American continents, not
    even an elementary nodule or crystal. Nephrite, or near-jade, and soft
    serpentine are common to both North and South America, but the jade
    of the ancient Maya cities is real jade, as easily distinguishable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
    from nephrite as a real diamond from ordinary glass. Furthermore, I
    have never found, nor have I seen, any similar objects taken from the
    ancient Maya cities which are of nephrite, though the present-day
    Indians, particularly in northern Mexico, file out objects of soft
    serpentine and sell them to the gullible tourist as <i lang="myn">chalchuitl</i>.
    The Nahuatl word <i lang="myn">chalchuitl</i> originally meant nephrite or American
    jade—near-jade—but even before the coming of the Spaniards the word
    had become prostituted to mean almost any greenish stone.</p>

  <p>“To the ancient Mayas jade was very precious—immeasurably more
    valuable than gold (sun metal), of which they had great store—even
    as in China to-day one may pay thousands of dollars for a string of
    perfect jade beads. The following authentic tale concerning Cortes
    and Montezuma illustrates the point. The story was recorded by one of
    Montezuma’s followers and has the ring of truth:</p>

  <p>“Although Montezuma was, toward the last, virtually the prisoner of
    Cortes, he was for a long time treated not as a prisoner but as an
    honored guest. Cortes and Montezuma were accustomed to play each day a
    native game which in many ways resembles chess, and both became much
    interested. It was their further custom at the close of each day’s game
    to present each other with some gift.</p>

  <p>“At the close of one day’s game the Aztec monarch presented Cortes with
    several large disks of gold and silver handsomely worked. Cortes was
    greatly pleased and so expressed himself. Montezuma smiled and said:
    ‘The gift of to-morrow shall be such that to-day’s gift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> will seem in
    value and preciousness, when compared with it, as no more than a single
    stone tile of the roadway.’</p>

  <p>“As may be supposed, the mighty Cortes spent a sleepless night in
    anticipation of the priceless gift he was to receive. At length the
    morrow came and the game was played to a long-drawn finish. The gift
    of Cortes to Montezuma does not matter, but the royal treasurer of
    Montezuma brought in on a golden salver the royal gift, four small
    carved jade beads. The bitter disappointment of Cortes was so great
    that he could scarcely conceal it, but Montezuma had acted in good
    faith, for jade had throughout the Aztec ages possessed an intrinsic
    value far above that of gold and silver.</p>

  <p>“So far as I can learn, the ancient Mayas considered silver of slight
    value, and they esteemed gold or sun metal more for its adaptability
    and malleability and its supposedly sacred origin than for its monetary
    value. It was an object of barter simply because of its utility in
    adornment and as a temple metal. Possibly copper may have had nearly as
    great a value in the eyes of these ancient people.</p>

  <p>“Of all the jade objects we recovered, not more than a fifth are
    unbroken, and the broken jade ornaments were broken not by chance or
    accident but deliberately and by a practised hand. The fractures are
    not the result of a casual crushing blow, but of the splitting or
    cleaving impact from a sharp-edged instrument guided by a deft hand, so
    that the jade was broken but not pulverized or marred. Like so many of
    the relics from the well, they had been killed, just as the bottoms of
    terra-cotta vessels were punctured and weapons were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> broken so that the
    departing soul of him who died might be accompanied by the souls of the
    material objects he had most loved or used during his earthly life. And
    when the departed souls completed the long journey and at last stood
    before the almighty Hunal Ku, the supreme god in the heavens, each
    would wear the souls of his earthly jewels and have at hand the souls
    of his earthly implements.</p>

  <p>“Although virtually all of the ancient rites and beliefs are unknown to
    the modern Mayas, this one belief has persisted in an esoteric fashion.
    Many years ago I attended the funeral of a young Maya woman whose
    husband had been devoted to her. Her burial attire was of the richest
    the family could possibly afford, the <i lang="myn">huipile</i> and <i lang="myn">pic</i> wonderfully
    embroidered of <i lang="myn">xoc-bui-chui</i> (embroidery of the counted threads). Her
    slippers of pink silk also were elaborately embroidered. Long slits had
    been cut in both <i lang="myn">pic</i> and <i lang="myn">huipile</i> where they would not be noticed,
    and the soles of the slippers each had three longitudinal slits cut
    in them. When I asked the old grandfather why this had been done, he
    professed ignorance and would only reply that it was the custom among
    his people. But when I told the old <i lang="myn">H’men</i> of Ebtun what I had seen,
    and of my conviction regarding it, he admitted that I was right and
    that the ancient belief and custom have been handed down through the
    generations, although the subject is never discussed with the Catholic
    clergy.</p>

  <p>“Always since that time and the finding of the jade in the great well
    I have thought of these lovely stones as ‘soul jewels,’ although,
    according to the Maya belief, their souls are departed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

  <p>“Unfortunately, some of the finds from the well were stolen. How many I
    do not know—not a great many, I think. But these things are priceless
    and it is cause for grief that even the least of them should fail to
    reach a safe place of exhibition. One of my natives abstracted some
    gold from the finds and had it melted up and made into a chain before
    we detected him. Later I found, also, that one of my straw bosses had
    been bribed by another archæologist to secrete and hand over for a
    price whatever of the finds he could. While I shall never know just
    what the sum of these losses was, it could not have been great, because
    no finds were brought up except in my presence, and every find that
    came under my eye was catalogued and accounted for.”</p>

      <span class="small">TWO LEGENDS</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ON one of Don Eduardo’s trips into the country of the Sublevados he
    chanced across an old Indian, the troubadour of his tribe. This man
    had a wonderful store of ancient traditions and legends and was an
    excellent spinner of tales. As nothing pleased him more than to sit
    by the hour and tell his stories to Don Eduardo—a most interested
    audience—they spent many pleasant days together. The following legend,
    especially, remains fresh in Don Eduardo’s memory and seems to me
    worthy of being recorded ere it dies for lack of appreciative ears.</p>

  <h3>IX-LOL-NICTE</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>My grandfather told me this, as his grandfather related it
      to him, and so on back through many grandfathers; and before
      that—who knows? There was in the north of this great land a
      city, and this city existed a thousand years before the coming
      of the white man. The dwellers in the land were called the
      children of Kukul Can. Afterward the Itzas, who were a mighty
      people, discovered this city and dwelt about the edge of its
      Sacred Well for many <i lang="myn">katuns</i>.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But before the time of the
      Itzas, the first dwellers had come to this land in big canoes,
      from the land of the mountains of fire. They were led by a
      great and wise man who aided them to build the city. The name
      of this man is written in stone in the ruins of the city.</p>

      <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

    <p>In the city was a high-born maiden, a princess named for a
      flower, for on the very night she was born, when the goddess
      Ixchel caressed her beautiful mother and placed in her loving
      arms a tiny girl child, the <i lang="myn">zac nicte</i> tree growing on the
      terraced platform of the big house on the hill burst into
      bloom for the first time and the tiny princess was named for
      its flowers, Ix-Lol-Nicte—She the Flower of Sweet Perfume.
      Each year thereafter the <i lang="myn">zac nicte</i> tree, the Mayflower tree
      of the Mayas, flourished and brought forth its fragrant snowy
      blossoms. Each year the princess grew in comeliness until she
      became the most graceful, lovely maid that eyes ever rested
      upon. Sixteen Mays had the <i lang="myn">zac nicte</i> tree been crowned with
      blossoms and sixteen Mays had passed since the girl-child was
      born to the beautiful mother in the great house on the hill.</p>

    <p>As the summer passed, the trunk and branches of the <i lang="myn">zac nicte</i>
      turned to ashy gray, but its leaves remained green and its
      blossoms lingered in masses of white fragrance. So beautiful
      had the maid become that it seemed the greatest honor in all
      the land must be hers. She must become the bride of Noh-och
      Yum Chac, the Rain God, whose palace is at the bottom of the
      Sacred Well. Surely the god would be pleased with her, for
      never had he had a bride half so fair. The time was at hand
      for the wedding of the water-god and a mortal maid. The god,
      who controlled the vase of waters, the dew, and the rain, and
      at whose will the corn grew luxuriously or withered and died,
      must be mollified. Each year, if it became evident the Rain God
      was angry with his people, the most beautiful maiden in the
      land was chosen to be thrown into the well, to sink quickly to
      his watery home and become his favorite handmaiden and win his
      forgiveness for her people.</p>

    <p>Ix-Lol-Nicte grew in loveliness, and yet no man had seen her,
      nor had she looked upon the face of any man, save only those of
      the trusted household retainers. The home of the princess, with
      its carved stone walls, thick and massive, loomed majestically
      above the palm-thatched homes of the common people. In the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
      spacious garden was a riot of tropic flowers, exotic shrubs,
      and twisting vines, giving forth wave upon wave of sweet
      perfume. Among the trees of grateful shade was the <i lang="myn">yax-nic</i>,
      whose bark is used to make the drink of the gods and whose
      clusters of lilac blooms formed a perfect background for the
      vivid flame of the <i lang="myn">copte</i> tree.</p>

    <p>Care-free, with no thought of the future to darken her
      innocent pleasures, the princess drifted happily about the
      garden, with only the companionship of the wild creatures
      that peopled the inclosure. And they sensed with unerring
      intuition the gentleness of her presence and bared not against
      her claw, fang, nor sting. In the sunny garden the little wild
      honey-bees, shining black like bits of jet, clung to her glossy
      tresses, loath to leave her fragrant presence. The big, lazy
      black-and-yellow butterflies lit fearlessly upon her shoulders,
      fanning her lovingly with their slowly opening and closing
      wings. The <i lang="myn">bec-etch-ok</i>, the bird of a hundred songs, seemed
      to save for her his choicest selections as she wandered along
      the garden paths.</p>

    <p>Her first knowledge of sadness came with the death of her
      pet fawn which had fed upon a poisonous vine that grew in
      the garden undetected by the servants and gardeners. All day
      she sat in the shade of a big sapote tree, thinking of her
      little dead pet. Suddenly she heard a sound in the forest
      depths beyond the garden and she looked up to see a youth
      chasing a wild fawn which bounded over the undergrowth and
      into the garden, coming close to her as though beseeching her
      protection, and she stood up and kept the youth from further
      pursuit. Not knowing her to be a princess, he was very angry
      with her for spoiling the chase and called down upon her the
      curses of Cacunam, god of the hunters.</p>

    <p>But the princess was not at all alarmed, because, not knowing
      the ways of men, she did not realize that the wrath of a man is
      a very dreadful thing to a woman.</p>

    <p>“Beautiful boy,” she said, “why do you chase the baby deer?
      Go find Ek Balam, the black jaguar, or Noh-och Ceh, the giant

      grandfather deer who lives in the deep forest! No brave man
      would hunt such a defenseless little creature as a fawn.”</p>

    <p>The lad, who was of her own age, hung his head and was ashamed.
      Abashed by her imperious manner, he felt that one far superior
      addressed him, yet his pride was stung. Flinging back his head,
      he gazed at her with flashing eyes and said:</p>

    <p>“I come of a line of great warriors and I will show you I can
      fight even the wild <i lang="myn">tzimin</i> or the <i lang="myn">chacmool</i> [tiger].” So
      saying, he rushed off through the forest and was gone.</p>

    <p>A jungle pheasant gave its staccato whistle in the forest
      depths and all was still. For the first time in her life the
      princess felt loneliness creep over her, for she had not wished
      the youth to rush away.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“Thus do the gods of our people upset the plans of man,” said the
    story-teller, as he paused to roll and light a corn-husk cigarette.
    Looking up with a quizzical smile, he said, “Is it not so with the
    gods of the white people?” I assured him heartily and from personal
    experience that the plans of mice and men, white or otherwise, do have
    a peculiar faculty for going awry.</p>

  <p>With his fag burning freely, he continued the legend:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The memory of this meeting kept coming before the eyes of the
      youth and a strange restlessness possessed him, so that even
      the excitement of the chase no longer gave him pleasure. He
      himself knew not what had bewitched him and he fancied that
      he suffered from some fever. But ever the beautiful form and
      flowerlike face of the maid floated before his eyes. Asleep or
      awake, it was the same; he could not banish the lovely vision.
      He did not know her to be a princess, but he knew the big house
      on the hill and that nobility dwelt there.</p>

    <p>At length he went to his uncle, the great <i lang="myn">ah-kin-mai</i>, the
      high priest, and said:</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

    <p>“Tell me: am I not also of noble birth, like those who live on
      the hill in the big house?”</p>

    <p>His uncle regarded him curiously, for he was a wise as well
      as a very learned man and well he knew that when a youth asks
      about those of a house, he is not interested in any of the
      inmates but the maid who dwells there.</p>

    <p>“Be still, my son,” said he. “Forget that you have asked this
      question. The people on the hill are of the royal house, while
      you are but the son of a chief. Does the bird in the high
      tree-top know who is on the ground below? So it is with men.”</p>

    <p>The youth turned silently away and from then on held his own
      counsel, for he knew that the high priest, his uncle, held
      no thought of love or romance in his breast. But the next
      day he warily scaled the hill beyond the city walls, vowing
      in his heart that he would at least gaze once more upon the
      maid who had woven about him so potent a spell. As he reached
      the hilltop there was nothing to see but the tall, rough tree
      trunks and the heavy branches. The tree under whose shade the
      lovely maid had sat but yesterday was there, but its branches
      sheltered only a gay-plumaged motmot perched on the lowest
      branch, jeering at him with its raucous voice. A weight lay
      heavy on his heart.</p>

    <p>“Hateful bird! Pitiless sun! Unfriendly forest!” thought he.
      Was it possible the gods might be angry because he dared to
      invade the privacy of the big house on the hill? He turned
      sadly to depart, but determined to come again even though the
      gods be wroth. He had taken but a few steps when a sweet voice
      directly behind him asked mockingly:</p>

    <p>“Do you hunt the baby deer to-day? Or, perchance, the bluebird,
      that sings so sweetly in the tree-tops?” The boy turned at the
      first word and his courage returned, for the evil bird had
      flown, the sun was never more glorious, and the forest suddenly
      seemed friendly.</p>

    <p>“I hunt a rare flower that grows high up in the dwellings of
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
      men,” he replied, “and there is joy in my heart now, for at
      last I have found it.”</p>

    <p>The maid did not answer, for she was unused to the ways of men
      and of flatteries, but she sat down under the tree where she
      had sat before and said:</p>

    <p>“Tell me, handsome youth, are the people who dwell in the city
      below as good to look upon as you?”</p>

    <p>The youth did not know what to say or answer, for he realized
      at once how far above him the maiden must be to dare ask such
      a question, and how closely guarded she must be to know so
      little of the dwellers of the city. But this only increased his
      determination to come again and again, until the heart of the
      girl should respond to the beating of his own.</p>

    <p>In a short time a path was worn up the hillside and through
      the forest, and often the birds looked down upon the lovers as
      they spoke of the plans of the girl’s family that she become
      the bride of the Rain God. The princess had been taught that to
      be called to serve in the subterranean palace of the god was
      the greatest honor and happiness that could come to any maiden,
      whether high-born or of lowly birth. Until now, until the
      coming of this youth, she had accepted eagerly the possibility
      of becoming the bride of the Rain God. But of late her heart
      had grown strangely chilled whenever she thought of this honor
      that might be hers.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the youth, who came from a family noted for its
      energy and decision, bided his time and kept his own counsel.
      His plan was formed. The princess must not be sacrificed to the
      grim keeper of the Sacred Well, whether god or devil. He would
      steal her away and bear her off to some distant province before
      ever she could be chosen for the Rain God. He dared not tell
      the princess of his plan, for he knew her awe and fear of the
      gods. But to himself he said:</p>

    <p>“Surely if I take her away before the day of the choosing, that
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
      will not be opposing the will of the gods, for they will not
      yet have spoken their decree.”</p>

    <p>Now Ix-Ek [Brunette], daughter of the great war chief Ek-Chac
      [Dark Red One], was as beautiful to the eye and in outward
      semblance as gentle as Ix-Lol-Nicte. It had been rumored that
      the high honor of serving the Rain God in his deep home might
      be hers. Those who knew her best, who knew the workings of her
      artful mind and cruel heart, shook their heads and said in
      secret:</p>

    <p>“Surely the gods who can read the minds and what is in the
      hearts of men, even as <i lang="myn">H’men</i> the high priest, does with the
      ills of the body by means of his magic crystal—surely they
      will never choose Ix-Ek!”</p>

    <p>But Ix-Ek knew nothing and cared less about the secret
      whisperings. The desire to be the chosen of the gods became
      stronger and stronger in her heart as she perceived that
      Ix-Lol-Nicte was a rival for that coveted honor. And the hour
      for the final choice drew nearer and nearer.</p>

    <p>It was by the merest chance that the handsome youth passed
      within the sight of Ix-Ek. At once it came to her like a bolt
      from the blue that she did not in the least want to serve the
      Rain God in his damp abode, and that the only happiness in
      the world for her was to bask in the tempestuous adoration of
      this unknown youth. Artfully she found a way to know him and
      to make it seem that he had sought her of his own volition.
      To him, unused to the wiles that an artful woman ever has at
      her command, she seemed so tender and compassionate that he,
      knowing nothing of her passion,—for who can see the moon when
      the sun is shining?—impulsively confided to her his love for
      Ix-Lol-Nicte. And Ix-Ek, concealing the jealousy that seethed
      in her heart, that she might better work out her terrible
      design, sweetly promised to aid him in securing his heart’s
      desire.</p>

    <p>As silently as the poisonous yellow spider of the jungle spins
      and spins its web, so did Ix-Ek spin her web of deceit and
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
      falsehood to bring the choice of the gods upon Ix-Lol-Nicte
      and thus separate her by death from the youth upon whom Ix-Ek
      had set her own evil heart. The jealous rage of an unscrupulous
      woman knows no bounds, obeys no laws, sacred or otherwise, and
      stops at nothing. So Ix-Ek schemed in secret and acted upon her
      plan.</p>

    <p>Just as the plans of the youth were perfected, even to the
      litter that was to bear Ix-Lol-Nicte away with him, and stout
      bearers, men of his own service, the high priest announced that
      the day of the choosing had arrived and that all who were to
      participate in the ceremony were to be in instant readiness.
      The young man knew that as one of the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i> bearers and
      especially appointed guard to the king he must be present at
      the ceremony. Failure on his part to be on hand, by an ancient,
      unchangeable law meant degradation for his entire family beyond
      all pardon and for himself enslavement.</p>

    <p>On the great square before the Pyramid of Sacrifice stood the
      platform of Noh-och Can, the Great Serpent, where would be
      enacted the ceremony of choosing the betrothed of the Rain
      God. At the very center of the platform was a massive seat,
      or throne of carved stone, used in this ceremony since the
      earliest days of the Sacred City. Over the seat was a gorgeous
      gold-embroidered canopy with a circular opening in the top, so
      that the rays of the sun might shine directly upon the person
      seated there.</p>

    <p>This was in the month of the New Sun. The early summer rains
      had passed, though every now and then a fleecy cloud swam
      through the azure and obscured the direct brightness of Ich-Kin
      [the Eye of Day], Earth was at its best, covered everywhere
      with a tender verdure accustomed to plentiful moisture and now
      suffering the first pangs of thirst which might wither and
      parch it should the Rain God not relent.</p>

    <p>At a given point in the solemn rites, the high priest would
      call one beautiful maid after another to occupy the sacred seat
      and the one upon whom the unclouded sun shone longest was the
      choice of the gods for betrothal to the Rain God. Thus Ich-Kin,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
      the greatest of the gods, would choose the virgin bride for
      his brother, the Rain God.</p>

    <p>A vast crowd from the city and from far regions had gathered to
      witness the majestic ceremony. An oppressive stillness was over
      all, and in the silence was the solemn feeling of the nearness,
      the very presence of the gods as they awaited the choosing of
      their lovely mortal handmaiden.</p>

    <p>Shattering the stillness came the shrill, weird notes of the
      flute and the keening of the sacred whistle, mingled with the
      rolling boom of the drum as the multitude joined in the slow
      chant of the ritual music, rolling out in a mighty sea of sound.</p>

    <p>At length the high priest raised his hand and the music ceased.
      Taking a vase of fragrant smoldering incense, he approached
      with measured pace to each of the four corners of the platform,
      symbolizing the four corners of the earth, and as he came to
      each corner he wafted the smoke of the incense toward each of
      the symboled <i lang="myn">Bacabes</i> who support the four corners of the
      earth upon their faithful shoulders and asked, by invocation,
      their blessing upon this ancient ceremony.</p>

    <p>Four times he did this and then announced that the gods were
      favorable. The priestly blower of the sacred trumpet blew two
      long blasts from his great conch-shell, and as the echo died
      away, Ix-Lol-Nicte descended from her curtained palanquin and,
      trembling from head to foot, walked toward the throne. She
      was attired in a long pure-white robe, adorned only at the
      throat and hem with the exquisite embroidery of the counted
      threads, worked by the temple nuns. Clusters of <i lang="myn">chan-cala</i>,
      black and shining as jet beads,—the color worn in honor of the
      West God,—lay against her fluttering breast. Before her went
      attendants, scattering large white and yellow blossoms, flowers
      of the gods of North and South.</p>

    <p>Slowly, with graceful dignity, unfaltering yet fearful, she
      approached the great stone chair. In her heart she prayed
      desperately that the choice of the gods might not fall upon
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
      her, for how could her adoration turn even to an immortal god
      when before her eyes was the beloved image of the mortal youth
      of the hillside?</p>

    <p>Upon her the throng gazed with wondering eyes. Beauty had been
      expected, but not this vision of virginal loveliness—a maid
      upon whom even the gods must gaze with rapturous and humble
      admiration! As she seated herself upon the throne it seemed
      to the onlookers as if the gods had already endowed her with
      sacred attributes, and an involuntary sigh came from each bosom
      in the dense throng.</p>

    <p>Again the high priest raised his hand, and now the drum alone
      beat in pulsing cadence to the movement of the <i lang="myn">caluac</i> or
      scepter which he held. Seated before the maiden was the
      <i lang="myn">Uinic-xoco</i>, or counter, who recorded the beats of the drum.
      At length the <i lang="myn">caluac</i> in the hands of the high priest came
      to rest, the drum ceased to beat, and Ix-Lol-Nicte with her
      attendants left the platform.</p>

    <p>Then came Ix-Ek, and she too was beautiful; as vivid as the
      scarlet berries that shone upon her breast. A murmur of
      admiration came from the onlookers and Ix-Ek turned and gazed
      at them disdainfully, for to her these people were as the dust
      underfoot. She bore herself with haughty pride, and if she felt
      any fear her bearing did not show it. A short time before, she
      had craved the honor of becoming the bride of the Rain God, but
      now she was passionately enamoured of a mortal youth and she
      was pulsating with the love that filled her heart. Whatever the
      honor, she no longer wished that sleep in which the eye of life
      is forever closed.</p>

    <p>Once more the high priest raised his hand, the drum-beats
      ceased, and the people silently returned to their homes. The
      solemn ceremony of the choosing was over, but the choice of the
      gods, by ancient custom, might not be made known until ten days
      had passed.</p>

    <p>With heavy heart the young man returned to his father’s house,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
      for he had seen not even the tiniest cloud pass over the face
      of the sun while his adored Ix-Lol-Nicte sat in the great stone
      chair. It seemed inevitable that she would be the choice of
      the gods and the thought was as a knife in his breast. As he
      lay upon his couch, stricken with anguish, there came to him a
      messenger from Ix-Ek, saying:</p>

    <p>“Come to me. I will help you and yet not anger the gods, for I
      know that Ix-Lol-Nicte was chosen.”</p>

    <p>Swiftly he went to the house of Ix-Ek and shook the string of
      hollow shells before the curtained entrance. At the first sound
      Ix-Ek stood beside him, brilliantly beautiful in her rich garb,
      her cheeks flushed and eyes bright with excitement. Even the
      love-blinded and despairing lover of Ix-Lol-Nicte gazed at her,
      spellbound for a moment with admiration, before his poignant
      grief once more engulfed him and he listened in hopeless
      silence while she spoke.</p>

    <p>“You must tell Ix-Lol-Nicte that if she is really chosen she
      must hold her body straight and like an arrow, so that it will
      enter the water as the jade-tipped dart from the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>,”
      she said. “I know the under priests who are to hold her at
      the brink of the well and fling her in. I will tell them that
      the gods have whispered to the high priest that the Rain God
      desires no new bride this year and that they are to fling her
      carefully so that her body shall not turn in the air but shall
      cleave the water like an arrow. Thus she shall come again to
      the surface, unharmed. Be you ready to rescue her and it will
      seem merely as though the Rain God had refused the sacrifice.
      Fear not. I know the priests and they will do as I say. Is not
      my father their chief, with power of life and death over them?
      Have no fear; they will obey me without question.”</p>

    <p>Hope returned to the heart of the youth and he called down the
      blessing of heaven upon Ix-Ek, his ears dulled to the serpent
      hiss of her voice, his sight unheeding the crafty, cruel
      glitter of her eyes. And that night he haunted the forest close
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
      by the royal abode of Ix-Lol-Nicte, while the Ox-ppel-Ek, the
      stars of the Three Marys, like white sentinels, gazed down
      upon him in pity as he gave the familiar signal, the cry of
      the night-bird. Soon the white-robed, weeping Ix-Lol-Nicte was
      locked in his arms. And when she could speak she whispered
      between her sobs:</p>

    <p>“Let this be our last farewell. It is the will of the gods
      and I must go quickly, for since the choosing I am watched
      continually.”</p>

    <p>Kneeling at her feet, the youth told her of the plan of Ix-Ek
      and she was convinced by his eager young eloquence. Her stifled
      sobs ceased and the flame of hope warmed her and calmed her
      fears, for her faith in her lover was as great as her love for
      him.</p>

    <p>Alone once more and without the reassuring nearness and vital
      strength of the boy, her fears returned and she distrusted
      Ix-Ek, because the intuition of a woman often reaches where
      the reasoning of a man fails to penetrate, and in her heart
      the maid knew that Ix-Ek sought only to destroy her. But she
      resolved to say nothing to her lover to dim his hope, and to
      trust only that the gods, knowing all that was in her breast
      and that she could never serve the Rain God with a whole heart,
      would in their all-seeing beneficence refuse her pitiful
      sacrifice.</p>

    <p>When ten days had passed, the high priest announced that
      Ix-Lol-Nicte was in truth the choice of the gods, and soon came
      the fateful day. Ix-Ek, aided by the nether gods and guided
      by Hun-Ahau, the arch-fiend himself, carried out her evil
      plan. She had seen and instructed the two brawny <i lang="myn">nacons</i> who
      were to cast Ix-Lol-Nicte into the Sacred Well, but instead
      of directing them as she had promised the youthful lover of
      Ix-Lol-Nicte, she told them that the high priest had had a
      vision and unless Ix-Lol-Nicte were accepted by the Rain God,
      priests and all would die before sunset; and she urged them
      to fling the maid with all their strength so that she should
      turn again and again in the air and strike the water with fatal
      impact.</p>

    <p>The sturdy, slow-witted under priests, befuddled by the words
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
      of Ix-Ek, did not, as was the custom, fling the slight form of
      the victim far out toward the center of the well, but let fall
      the tender body of Ix-Lol-Nicte so that it struck the terrible
      rocky side of the pit. A mutilated, bloody corpse at last sank
      beneath the green waters.</p>

    <p>Her lover, standing at the brink of the well beside the covered
      bower of the king and poised to dive into the water to aid
      Ix-Lol-Nicte the moment her lovely head should reappear above
      the surface, saw her body strike the rocks. Turning like a
      flash, he rushed to Ix-Ek and threw her far out into the well
      as one would throw a small stone. Then he leaped upon the two
      dazed under priests and dragged them over the brink so that all
      three fell like plummets into the watery pit.</p>

    <p>Horror overwhelmed the high priest and all others who stood
      there. They knew that a portentous thing had happened and that
      the wrath of the gods would swiftly be upon them. Enormous
      clouds, as black as the berries upon the dead breast of
      Ix-Lol-Nicte, came rushing from the four corners of the horizon
      and surged high up in the heavens, meeting as one. A single
      bolt of lurid lightning split the firmament and entered the
      Sacred Well, and the thunder made the rock walls shudder and
      the whole earth to tremble. The Rain God, angered that his
      people had turned the sacred sacrifice into a day of evil,
      caused the heavens to pour down upon them such a deluge that
      hundreds were swept into the well and battered to death on its
      jagged, rocky sides or drowned in its depths.</p>

    <p>Others fled, to escape the wrath of the gods, but few reached
      the shelter of their homes.</p>

    <p>When the terrible storm was at last over, only a few houses
      were left and a decimated population. The big <i lang="myn">zac nicte</i> tree,
      which had blossomed for the first time when Ix-Lol-Nicte was
      born, now lay upon the ground, its gray trunk split and torn
      and its lovely fragrant blossoms bruised and crushed. But if
      one had looked closely he might have seen that the heart of
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
      the tree had been eaten out by a big, dark worm with stripes
      of brilliant red, red and vivid as the carmine berries on the
      breast of Ix-Ek.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The old man—soothsayer, story-teller, wizard of Zactun—also told the
    legend of Xkan-xoc, the forest bird, choosing his words carefully,
    with long waits between puffs of his husk-wrapped cigarette; and
    the measured cadence of his voice, together with the white magic of
    midnight moonlight, made his stories live and clothed his legendary
    characters with flesh and blood for the enchanted eyes of the listener.</p>

  <h3>XKAN-XOC, THE FOREST BIRD</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>There was a time when the wrath of the Rain God was over the
      land. He had sent the dry wind to work his will and all the
      country of the Mayas lay parching and dying. The leaves of
      vines and shrubs and trees first twisted and contorted in
      their agony of thirst and then crumbled away. The black earth
      turned to dust, blown about by the winds, and the red earth was
      baked as hard as the tiles in the roadway. The old men, wise
      with the knowledge of years and many famines, and whose ears
      knew the inner meaning of small sounds which most people think
      insignificant, said that the deep earth cried out and groaned
      in its hot anguish.</p>

    <p>The <i lang="myn">ah-kin</i>, priest of the Rain God, who lived at the verge of
      the Sacred Well, told his people that the mighty God of Rain
      was displeased because more copal incense had not been burned
      at his shrine, and that he must be appeased at once or no corn,
      no beans, no peppers would grow in the whole land.</p>

    <p>A new maid must be sent to him, one so beautiful that he would
      wish to keep her as his bride and his gratitude would be shown
      by gentle and frequent rains that would revive the dying maize.
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
      The mortal messenger must be the loveliest virgin in all the
      country, without a flaw, absolutely without the slightest
      blemish on any part of her body. Her voice must be as sweet as
      that of <i lang="myn">Xkoke</i>, the wood-thrush, so that the sound of it as
      she spoke to the god in behalf of her people might be as music
      to his ears.</p>

    <p>The great and wise men met in council,—the king, the lords,
      the priests, the mighty warriors,—and picked men, hundreds of
      them, were sent to comb the country-side and the cities and the
      depths of the forest to find a fitting bride for the god. There
      was not a maid in Yucatan or even in lands far to the south
      upon whose face one or another of these ambassadors would not
      look. And only a few maidens, those of surpassing beauty, would
      be sent to the sacred city for the ceremony of the choosing.</p>

    <p>From the humble house of her father in the depths of the Tiger
      Forest came Xkan-xoc, carried swiftly on a flower-decked
      litter, borne by strong young men, the sons of nobles. Garlands
      of flowers and sweet-scented herbs shaded her from the heat
      of the sun. Her thirst was quenched with the milk of new corn
      and wild honey. Her food was especially prepared by the vestal
      virgins of the temple.</p>

    <p>And upon the day of the choosing her <i lang="myn">pic</i> and <i lang="myn">huipile</i> were
      made of shining, soft tree-cotton, lustrous as the wings of
      a sea-bird, that clung to her slender gracefulness. Glinting
      green stones hung pendent from her ears, while about the lovely
      slender column of her neck were entwined many small fretted
      chains of gleaming sun metal. Her eyes were big and dark like
      those of a fawn; her voice as soft and sweet as the dawn breeze
      swaying the fronds of the <i lang="myn">cocoyal</i> palm or ruffling the petals
      of the hibiscus flower. Tiny sandals of softest doeskin covered
      her feet as she was led to the temple to be prepared for the
      sacrifice.</p>

    <p>The high priest donned his vestments, the lesser priests
      brought rich votive offerings and baskets of incense, both
      copal and rubber. The king and his guard of noble <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>
      bearers took their stations and all the people of the city
      gathered at the edge of the Well.</p>

    <p>The first dulcet tones of the sacred flute were heard from the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
      temple of Kukul Can at the far end of the Sacred Way and the
      shrilling of the sacred whistles joined with the flutes and the
      reverberating boom of the <i lang="myn">tunkul</i>, the sacred drum. A sudden
      silence, a strange ominous stillness—then was heard from
      the depths of the temple the wailing of all the white-robed
      virgins. And swiftly the news traveled. Xkan-xoc cannot be sent
      as the messenger to the Rain God, for, in preparing her for the
      ceremony, the vestal virgins have discovered a tiny mole or
      birthmark upon her breast, which had been overlooked previously.</p>

    <p>The ceremony stopped and the people dispersed with heavy
      hearts, for Xkan-xoc might not be sent to the Rain God, and
      beside her all other beautiful maidens seemed unlovely. Another
      maid must be selected for the sacrifice and how might the Rain
      God be moved by a bride, however lovely, after seeing the
      divinely fair Xkan-xoc?</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER X<br />
      <span class="small">THE CONQUEST</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IN “The Fair God” General Lew Wallace has given a somewhat fanciful but
    in the main faithful description of the conquest of Montezuma and the
    Aztecs by Cortes and his Spanish knights and men-at-arms.</p>

  <p>The conquest of the Mayas is a similar story of blood and plunder in
    which the Mayas, although far outnumbering the Spaniards, were no
    match for the superior knowledge and weapons of the white men. And, as
    always, where the flag of Spain went the church followed close behind
    and consolidated and held the conquered as arms alone never could have
    done.</p>

  <p>Bishop Landa says that Gerónimo de Aguilar with some companions was
    the first to try his luck in Yucatan. He and his men took part in the
    destruction of the city of Darien in 1511. He accompanied another
    leader, Valdivia, in a caravel from Santo Domingo. They ran aground at
    a place called Viboras, on the coast of Jamaica, and the ship was lost
    with all but twenty men. Aguilar and Valdivia with the few survivors
    set out in a small boat without sails and without food and were
    thirteen days at sea, before, by chance, they reached Yucatan. In that
    time half of the little band died of starvation.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching land they fell into the hands of a bad Maya chief; he
    immediately sacrificed Valdivia and four others to the native gods, and
    the people feasted upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> their bodies. Aguilar, his chief lieutenant,
    Guerrero, and four or five others were left to fatten for a subsequent
    sacrifice, but they escaped and reached another tribe which was at war
    with the bad chief. Here they were kept as slaves, and though they were
    mercifully treated, nearly all of them died of disease except Aguilar
    and Guerrero. The former was a good Christian, according to Bishop
    Landa’s account, and kept his prayer-book, and in 1517 he returned
    to Spain with Hernan Cortes. Guerrero, however, appears to have been
    less pious; he allied himself with a native chief and together they
    conquered many native tribes. Guerrero taught the natives how to fight
    and how to build fortifications. He conducted himself like an Indian,
    painting his body, letting his hair grow long, and wearing ear-rings,
    and married the daughter of a chief. It is thought he became an
    idolator.</p>

  <p>In 1517 Francisco Hernandez de Córdoba set sail from Santiago de Cuba
    with three ships, for the purpose, some say, of obtaining new slaves
    for the mines. Others say he went to discover new land. He arrived at
    length at the island of Mujeres (women), which name he gave it because
    of the native goddesses of the island—Aixchel, Ixche-beliax, Ixhunie,
    and Ixhunieta. The Spaniards were surprised to find the women fully
    clothed and to see buildings of stone and articles of gold. The latter
    they took with them. Sailing into the bay of Campeche, they landed upon
    the coast of Yucatan on the Sunday of Lazarus and called the place of
    their arrival Lazarus. They were well received by the natives, who were
    struck with awe and wonderingly touched the beards and persons of the
    strangers.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

  <p>Near the sea the Spaniards beheld a square stone monument with steps
    leading up to it on all four sides. On the summit was a stone idol,
    with the figures of two wild animals gnawing at his flanks, and a huge
    stone serpent in the act of swallowing a leopard. All were smeared
    with blood from frequent sacrifices. A little way inland was the city
    of Champoton, which the chief would not permit the Spaniards to enter,
    bringing forth his warriors against them. This saddened Francisco
    Hernandez, but he put his forces in order and caused the artillery of
    his ships to be fired.</p>

  <p>The natives, however, did not cease their attack, although the noise
    and smoke and fire of cannon must have been terrifying to them who had
    never seen nor heard such things before. The bloodshed was terrible,
    for the natives died in hundreds, but still they pressed on, driving
    the Spaniards back to their ships. Of the Spaniards, twenty were
    killed, fifty wounded, and two taken alive who were later sacrificed.
    Hernandez himself received thirty-three wounds.</p>

  <p>Returning to Cuba, he told Diego Velasquez, the governor, of the
    richness of the land and of the abundance of gold, and Velasquez
    despatched his nephew, Juan de Grijalva, with four ships and two
    hundred men, on May 1, 1518, to undertake the conquest of Yucatan. One
    of the ships was commanded by Francisco de Montejo. They cruised along
    the whole coast and finally attempted to besiege the city of Champoton
    again, but with no better fortune than their predecessors. One Spaniard
    was killed and fifty wounded, among them Grijalva.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

  <p>When the Spaniards returned to Cuba Hernan Cortes became greatly
    excited upon hearing the news of so much land and such riches and
    determined to conquer the country in the name of God and his king. He
    outfitted eleven ships, the largest being of one hundred tons. Among
    their captains was Francisco de Montejo. There were five hundred men in
    the expedition, horses, war-gear, and goods for trading or ransom.</p>

  <p>On the voyage one ship was thought to be lost, and with the ten
    remaining vessels an attack was made on the city of Cotoch, which was
    captured and plundered. Later the ship that was thought to be lost
    rejoined the rest. Cruising down the coast from northern Yucatan, the
    fleet came to the inhabited island of Cuzmil.</p>

  <p>The natives, seeing so many ships and so many soldiers, abandoned the
    place and fled inland. After despoiling the city, the Spaniards made a
    foray into the hinterland and came upon the wife of the chief and her
    children. They conversed with her by the aid of a native interpreter
    and treated her kindly. Many gifts were bestowed upon her and her
    children and she was induced to send word to the chief and bring him
    before them. When he came, he too was well treated and presented with
    gifts.</p>

  <p>The chief ordered all the dwellers to return to their homes and all
    of the loot that the Spaniards had taken was restored to its owners
    and confidence and friendship were established. The natives became
    converted to Christianity and the image of the Virgin was set up to
    replace the old stone idols. From the Indians Cortes learned that some
    white men were near by, in the power of a barbarous native chief. The
    friendly Indians were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> afraid to venture into the domain of the chief,
    but Cortes finally induced them to deliver the following letter by
    stealth to the white men:</p>

  <p class="noindent smcap">Noble Sirs:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I left Cuba with eleven armed ships and five hundred Spaniards
      and arrived here at Cuzmil, from where I write you this letter.
      Those of this island have assured me that there are on this
      land five or six cruel men and in all very similar to us. I do
      not know how to give or say other descriptions, but by these
      I guess and am sure you are Spaniards. I and these nobles who
      came with me to discover and populate these lands, request
      you that within six days after receiving this you come to us
      without other delay or excuse. If you come we shall all know
      one another and we shall reward the good work that from you
      this fleet receives. I send a brig in which to come and two
      ships for security.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This letter was carried by the natives, concealed in their hair, and
    it reached Aguilar, of whom I have previously spoken. He was not able,
    however, to make connection with the ships Cortes had sent and after
    six days the brig and its convoy ships returned to Cuzmil and Cortes
    immediately set sail with his whole fleet. Soon after embarking, one
    of the ships was damaged and the whole fleet returned to Cuzmil while
    repairs were made. The following day Aguilar arrived, having crossed
    the sea between Cuzmil and the mainland in a canoe. He cried for joy at
    finding his countrymen and knelt down and thanked God. He was taken,
    naked as he came, to Cortes, who clothed him and received him kindly.
    He told of his privations and of Guerrero, but it was not possible to
    reach the latter, who was then eighty leagues inland.</p>

  <p>With Aguilar, who was an excellent interpreter, Cortes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> again preached
    the worship of the Cross and made a great impression upon the
    inhabitants of Cuzmil. The fleet upon its return voyage touched at
    Campeche and at Tabasco, where the inhabitants gave to Cortes an Indian
    woman who was afterward called Marina. She came from Jalisco, was the
    daughter of noble parents, and had been stolen when small and sold as a
    slave in Tabasco and later in other cities. Thus she knew the language
    and much of the condition of the country.</p>

  <p>After his arrival in Cuba, Cortes and the governor determined to send
    Montejo to the Spanish court, to carry to the king his fifth of the
    treasure resulting from the expedition and to secure a grant for the
    conquest and settlement of Yucatan. When Montejo reached Spain, Bishop
    Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca was prime minister, with full power over
    New Spain. The reports rendered to the minister by Diego Velasquez,
    governor of Cuba, were by no means in praise of Cortes, and as a result
    Montejo, his emissary, found himself in a most unfavorable position.
    It was only after seven years of what must have been heartbreaking
    delay that he persuaded the president of the council and Pope Adrian
    to approve the mission. The king had been long absent in Flanders, but
    now an audience with his Majesty was granted and Montejo succeeded
    in clearing Cortes and in getting the king’s grant for the conquest
    of Yucatan, and with it the title for himself of governor of the new
    province.</p>

  <p>As soon as possible he outfitted three ships and sailed with five
    hundred men. His destination was the island of Cuzmil, which was safely
    reached and where he was well received by the Christianized natives.
    After a brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> time he went to the mainland, where his first act was
    to plant the flag of Spain with the words, “In the name of God, I take
    possession of this land for God and the King of Castile.” He then
    sailed down the coast to the city of Conil. The natives were greatly
    alarmed and sent word throughout the country of the advent of the
    Spanish. All of the chiefs for some distance about were persuaded to
    visit Montejo, who received them with honor and respect. But one chief
    of great strength was accompanied by a negro servant, who carried,
    concealed, a cutlass, and at a favorable moment the chief seized the
    weapon and tried to assassinate Montejo, who defended himself while his
    men disarmed the native.</p>

  <p>This event was disquieting; Montejo realized that in spite of his
    conference with the natives, they were unfriendly and that it would be
    unwise to risk his little army against their combined strength. And
    so he weighed anchor and proceeded farther down the coast, seeking
    the largest sea-coast city, which proved to be Tecoh. Here, either by
    friendly overtures or by threats, he gained permission to establish
    a city which he intended to make the capital of his new dominion.
    Traveling about the country, he came upon Chi-chen Itza, which seemed
    to him an ideal location, probably because of its stone buildings and
    its plentiful water-supply. He at once set about the task of making
    it habitable. Houses of wood with thatched roofs were put up and with
    the assistance of friendly natives he began the task of subduing
    surrounding tribes, placing some one or another of his men in charge of
    the villages as they were conquered, until he had two or three thousand
    natives in his power.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

  <p>By this time the natives awoke to the fact that they were fast becoming
    slaves to the Spaniards, and rebellion set in everywhere. For a time
    Montejo with his men was able, by cruel and bloody treatment, to keep
    the people in subjection; but at last they forced him to draw in all
    his forces to Chi-chen Itza, where they besieged him. Each day the
    armed and mailed Spaniards took heavy toll of their besiegers; and each
    day the Indians were reinforced, while the Spaniards counted every
    victory a defeat which lost them even a few in killed or wounded. And
    the food-supply was nearly exhausted.</p>

  <p>Finally Montejo perceived that he and his men must escape and return to
    the island of Cuzmil or they would all be slain. Through the day they
    wearied the native besiegers with skirmish and sortie and that night
    they tied a famished dog to a rope attached to a bell and just out of
    reach placed some food. All night the dog tried in vain to reach the
    food and all night the natives heard the sound of the bell and thought
    the Spaniards were preparing a night attack. But the wily Montejo and
    his followers had escaped from the rear of the ancient “Nunnery” and it
    was several hours before the besiegers discovered what had happened.</p>

  <p>Not knowing which road the fleeing enemy had taken, the Indians set
    out at once by all the roads to the sea-coast. Some of them actually
    caught up with the retreating forces, but were too few in number to
    attack successfully. The Spaniards reached safely the town of Zilan and
    the Christianized tribe of the Cheles (Bluebirds) and from there they
    easily made their way to Ticoh, where they were secure for some months.</p>

  <p>Montejo saw that conquest to the southward was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> blocked, and, with the
    aid of the friendly Cheles and taking the chief of the town of Zilan
    and two young nobles, the sons of a still greater chief, he traveled
    with his force up the coast, the young natives of his escort obtaining
    safe conduct for him through the various tribes. Thus he reached
    Mexico, which was held by the iron hand of Cortes.</p>

  <p>Montejo was next sent to Honduras as viceroy, but the project of
    subduing Yucatan seems always to have been his dream. Some years later
    he went to the city of Chiapa and from there despatched his son, at the
    head of an expedition, to Yucatan, in a further effort to conquer it.
    The younger Montejo had in the meantime traveled through Mexico and
    even into lower California and had been made viceroy of Tabasco.</p>

  <p>In the years since the attempt of the elder Montejo to subdue the
    Mayas, Yucatan had suffered greatly, first from internecine strife
    and then from a famine, so that the younger Montejo found almost no
    organized resistance. The city of Champoton, where the Spaniards had
    twice suffered defeat under Hernandez de Córdoba and under Grijalva,
    and where the first Montejo had not dared to risk a conflict, now
    offered no battle at all. From there the younger Montejo went to
    Campeche and established friendly relations, so that with the aid of
    Champoton and Campeche, gained by promises of rich rewards, he reached
    the city of Tiho, meeting with almost no resistance.</p>

  <p>Here he established his capital, renaming the city Mérida, and so
    it has remained to the present time as the seat of government of
    Yucatan. The army of a few hundred men was quartered in Mérida and the
    subjugation <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>of the country was carried on from there. Captains were
    sent to different towns as local governors. The young Montejo sent
    his cousin of the same name to Valladolid, to govern that important
    city and subdue the surrounding territory. When things had pretty
    well settled down, the elder Montejo came from Chiapa, first taking
    up residence in Campeche, which he renamed San Francisco in honor of
    himself. A little later he moved on to Mérida and became governor in
    fact, as well as in name, of the land of Yucatan.</p>

  <p>The rule of the Spaniards was exceedingly brutal for some years, but
    it is believed that most of their cruelties were committed without
    the knowledge of Montejo and certainly not at his command. There
    is the well-worn excuse that the conquerors were few in number and
    the conquered numerous, and that diabolical treatment was sometimes
    necessary, to hold the masses in check. Rebels were burned alive and
    hanged in great numbers. The important people in the town of Yobain
    were gathered together in a large house and locked in stocks, then the
    house was set on fire, so that all perished horribly.</p>

  <p>Diego de Landa himself saw a tree upon which were hanging many Indian
    women from whose feet their little children had been hanged. In another
    city two Indian women, one a maid, the other newly married, were hanged
    for no other reason than that they were beautiful and the Spanish
    captain feared that his men might seek their favor and thereby stir up
    trouble with the natives.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the greatest cruelty of all was the deportation of the natives
    of the thickly populated provinces of Cochua and Chectemal. Hands and
    arms and legs were lopped off. Women had their breasts severed and,
    with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> gourds tied to their feet, were thrown into the lagoons. Children
    were stabbed because they could not walk as fast as their captors, and
    men, women, and children were slain without excuse.</p>

  <p>Because of this treatment the native population decreased very rapidly
    and the towns and cities were abandoned. A serious outbreak occurred in
    Valladolid, where the natives slew seventeen Spaniards and four hundred
    natives who were servants of the Spanish. Hands and feet of the slain
    were sent through the country as a signal for a general uprising, but
    none took place.</p>

  <p>Evidently the priesthood complained to the king regarding the
    atrocities that were being committed and of the making of servants
    or virtually slaves of many of the natives. An edict from the king
    deprived all governors of native servants. Montejo was impeached and
    sent to Mexico for a hearing, and from there to the royal council at
    Madrid. And there he died, as Landa says, “full of days and work.”</p>

  <p>The younger Montejo left the imposing gubernatorial mansion which his
    father had built in Mérida and resided for some time in the city merely
    as a private citizen, much respected by all. After a time he went to
    Guatemala and then returned to Spain, where he eventually died after a
    prolonged illness.</p>

  <p>As has been said, the church followed close upon the heels of the
    conquerors and there seems to have been little love lost between the
    priests and the soldiery, both jealous of power and wealth. With the
    forces of the elder Montejo was only one cleric, Francisco Hernandez,
    chaplain of the expedition, who later attributed the failure of the
    venture to the lack of priests. Before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> real conquest by Montejo
    the younger, it became necessary for Antonio de Mendoza, who was
    viceroy of all New Spain, to carry out the orders he had long before
    received from Queen Juana to the effect that priests should be sent to
    Yucatan—one of the conditions upon which the province had been granted
    to Montejo.</p>

  <p>Mendoza had no choice but to send priests from other Spanish
    possessions under his command, as there were none in Yucatan. For this
    duty Fray Jacobo de Testera, who held a high clerical office in Mexico,
    volunteered. In 1531 he and three other priests arrived at Champoton
    and, having asked leave of the Indians to enter the country, made an
    auspicious beginning. But they soon lost the good-will of the natives
    because they insisted on burning the idols, and, on finding they were
    making no progress, became disgruntled and returned to Mexico. In 1536
    another band of friars essayed the task of Christianizing Yucatan, but
    after proselyting for two years they returned to more settled Spanish
    dominions.</p>

  <p>The conquest actually effected, after the founding of Valladolid in
    1541 and Mérida in 1542, a church was built in the latter city and in
    1544 Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas and his Dominican friars came to
    Yucatan and gradually spread the creed of the Cross throughout the
    land. But while we speak of the conquest as becoming an accomplished
    fact with the founding of the two principal cities of Valladolid and
    Mérida, it was not until more than eighty years later that the whole
    country was pacified, and during this time the Itzas in the southern
    part of the country remained unconquered and un-Christianized. These
    eighty years constitute a long period of guerilla warfare and sporadic
    attempts on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> part of the Spaniards to conquer the stubborn Itzas
    and efforts of the priests to convert them, and, throughout, showed a
    lack of concord between the military and the church. At one time two
    native Christians set up claims as pope and bishop respectively and
    gained a considerable following.</p>

  <p>As has been mentioned earlier in this work, some of the Maya
    tribes never were conquered; they do not, to this day, pay taxes
    to or otherwise concern themselves with the Government of Mexico.
    Catholicism, generously mixed with the old paganism, has, however,
    permeated their villages.</p>

  <p>Whatever we may think now of the means and methods followed by the
    old padres in bringing the heathen to the Christian faith, we can
    but admire and reverence their motives, for no earthly reward could
    possibly compensate for the incredible hardships despite which these
    zealots persevered. Only a stanch, all-abiding faith, supreme over
    mundane things, could have carried on.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">“ALWAYS in my earlier days in my City of the Sacred Well,” says Don
    Eduardo, “the question was in my mind as to the age of the city. Every
    carved stone I found, I scanned eagerly for some clue and I should say,
    perhaps, right here, that while we can often gain only an inkling of
    the meaning of the Maya hieroglyphs and in some cases no understanding
    at all, the date-glyphs are plain sailing. We can read them, I think,
    as readily as we would read dates written in English. With but a little
    training any one may do this.</p>

  <p>“But though I looked on engraved stones by the hundreds, there were
    no dates. Again and again I questioned the natives: ‘When do you think
    these buildings were erected and who built them?’ Invariably came the
    patient answer, ‘<i lang="es">Quien sabe?</i>’—‘Who knows?’</p>

  <p>“Among these Indians was an old fellow whose face hauntingly reminds
    me of an ancient picture of a Hebrew patriarch that I have seen in
    some forgotten place. One day we were clearing the brush from a gentle
    terrace to make ready for the planting of corn. I called the attention
    of my overseer to several mounds upon a large near-by terrace, telling
    him that we must surely dig into them as soon as we could find time,
    to see if they contained any relics. Suddenly my grizzled patriarch
    straightened up and gazed at the mounds and then came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> over to me,
    saying as he pointed to the tallest of the mounds, ‘That one has in it
    a stone book written by my fathers.’ Here at last was something, of
    no value, possibly, but better far than the eternal ‘<i lang="es">Quien sabe?</i>’
    Eagerly I asked him how he came by this idea and he said that in the
    days of his great, great grandfather this temple mound was known as
    Mul-huun-tunich, the Hill of the Stone Book. He said that he had been
    told this by his father and his grandsire had told his father and a
    high priest had so told his grandfather. I could get no more out of
    him, but he stuck doggedly to this brief tale.</p>

  <p>“I had passed the mound several times and now I gazed at it with fresh
    interest. It was covered with a tangled growth of vines and thicket
    and well-grown trees, reminding me of what some philosopher has so
    truly said—that the most perfect works of men are soon covered by
    forests which grow an inch a day. If this mound had ever been a stately
    edifice, all semblance had long since passed. The bat or serpent might
    find a cavity in its ruined space, but if any carving of god or hero
    were to be found, it was well hidden from my prying eyes.</p>

  <p>“At once I began the task of clearing away the young growth and the
    stumps of what had been sizable trees and beneath these were other
    decaying tree stumps. In this ruined area, which is perhaps three
    thousand feet to the south of the Great Pyramid of El Castillo, is a
    terrace, rising about twenty feet above the general level. On this
    terrace, which once had smooth, sloping sides, are ruined buildings
    with a bit here and there still standing, surrounded with shapeless
    heaps of fallen stone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> The hill of the stone book, as it was called by
    my old Indian, was on the northeastern edge of this terrace, pyramidal
    in form and sharply defined.</p>

  <p>“My better judgment told me I was wasting time in heeding the vaporings
    of the old Indian while more important tasks waited, but my interest
    and curiosity were touched and I urged my men to strenuous effort,
    resisting with difficulty the temptation to dig at once into the
    center of the mound. We cleared the undergrowth in patches and burned
    it, so that the valuable timber would not be injured by the heat, nor
    the stones in the mound calcined. While most of the men were thus
    engaged I selected a few picked workers and we began the excavation
    of the pyramidal mound. We found not only trees growing above buried
    stumps, but charred stumps even below these. My old Indian examined
    carefully the cuts upon these deep-buried stumps and logs and said that
    these marks had not been made by ax, hatchet, machete, or any modern
    implement that he had ever seen. In all probability this earliest
    felling was done before the coming of the white man with his cutting
    edges of metal.</p>

  <p>“I wondered who could have cut down the big trees around the pyramid.
    How could trees have been permitted to grow here or have been burned
    so close to buildings inhabited or in use? Evidently the burning and
    cutting, ancient as it might have been, had yet been done many, many
    years after the structure was abandoned.</p>

  <p>“At last we had a space cleared all around the base of the mound and we
    sorted over the loose stones, looking for inscriptions, but came across
    nothing of unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span> interest. We found the mound to be four-sided and
    truncated, with broad steps leading up all four sides and with the
    principal stairway facing the west. The pyramid was in ruins and the
    upper outline obliterated. Close to the base of the main stairway we
    uncovered a semi-recumbent stone figure, part man and part animal, of
    the so-called Chac Mool type. It was still firmly cemented in place
    and, like the stairway, faced the west. Just in front of this stone
    figure we unearthed a small elaborately carved stone urn of pineapple
    pattern, and a similar urn was dug up just to the rear of the Chac Mool
    figure. The Chac Mool and the incense urns were much marred and pitted
    by erosion, and the finding of charcoal in fragments and granules all
    about indicated that a deliberate effort had been made to destroy these
    priceless things.</p>

  <p>“Gradually we cleared the earth and fallen stones and mortar from the
    main staircase. Many nests of lovely mauve-colored wood-doves were
    destroyed as we felled the trees. We saved as many as we could, but for
    several hours the mournful cries of the bereaved feathered creatures
    sounded from the neighboring forest like the wails of the departed
    spirits of those who had lived and died beside this old, old temple.</p>

  <p>“On the southern slope a huge <i lang="myn">chaib</i>, a species of boa-constrictor,
    beautifully marked with splashes of green and brown, was awakened from
    its slumbers deep in some rocky cavity of the pyramid and came surging
    down the mound with watchful head held high and graceful body bending
    the bushes in its path as it disappeared into the thicket below.</p>

  <p>“The bees of Yucatan are kindly and have no sting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> but the wasps
    more than make up for the impotence of the bees. The most venomous
    wasps, the <i lang="myn">x-hi-chac</i>, build flat nests that cling as closely and
    unobtrusively to the tree trunks as porous plasters. One of the trees
    we felled contained such a nest. Lightning is slow compared with
    the speed of these insects, and I, personally, would just about as
    willingly be struck by lightning as to encounter the sting of the
    <i lang="myn">x-hi-chac</i>. I think lightning would be less painful. Several of the
    men were badly stung and while I gave them first aid by applying
    ammonia to their hurts, and provided drinks of a refreshing nature, the
    victims spent a sleepless, feverish night. They were weak and in low
    spirits in the morning, but we resumed our task nevertheless.</p>

  <p>“Clearing the way a step at a time, we finally reached a level,
    well-built platform at a height of thirty feet. At the rear of the
    platform was the jagged outlined wall of what had been a small temple
    and directly before it were two large Atlantean figures of unusual
    type. I had seen many squat stone figures in and about the city but
    never before such large ones or figures carved with such fierce
    grandeur of expression. They were intricately carved and highly
    conventionalized. Each was garbed in an embossed head-dress, breast
    pendants, loincloth, and sandals. Every detail was clearly worked, even
    to the carved strands of rope holding the sandals—sandals bearing
    a striking resemblance to those worn by the prehistoric or archaic
    Gauchos of the Canary Islands, which again suggests the plausibility of
    Plato’s Lost Atlantis.</p>

  <p>“And as we cleared the debris away it became evident that these massive
    figures, so stiff and majestic, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> originally sustained the front
    or façade of the temple. My curiosity and excitement had now reached
    a point where every slight delay was nerve-racking and the two grim
    guardians seemed to me like silent keepers of age-old secrets, ready
    to come to life and destroy the prying humans who dared invade their
    sacred domain.</p>

  <p>“Little by little we removed the earth and rubbish. Slowly we
    progressed between the colossal figures, excavating with great
    difficulty the compacted mortar and stone which had fallen and become
    almost as a single stone. About three feet back of the statues was a
    huge stone covered with inscriptions. Was it the stone book? I cast
    aside all philosophic calmness and dropped to my knees, clawing away
    with my bare hands at the debris which obscured the inscriptions, until
    my nails were broken and my fingers bleeding.</p>

  <p>“Here indeed was the Huun-tunich, the Stone Book, the Rosetta Stone of
    my ancient, lovely, and forgotten City of the Sacred Well! I am not
    ashamed of the fever of excitement which possessed me and communicated
    itself to my wondering Indians, who had not the slightest idea why the
    mad white man should become so wrought up over the finding of merely
    another stone with queer writings on it. But, then, what matter! White
    men are always a little insane, anyway, and one never knows what folly
    they will attempt next.</p>

  <p>“With sharpened twigs I cleaned out all the incised lines, until the
    inscription on the exposed face stood forth clearly. Not till then did
    I attempt to read it. And there, among the glyphs I could not at once
    decipher, my eye caught a date-sign fairly jumping out to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span> me.
    Cycle Ten, Katun Two, Tun Nine, Uinal One—in other words, 600 A.
    D.!</p>

  <p>“It had been my secret hope that somewhere, somehow, I should be able
    to find an authentic date in Chi-chen Itza, some inscription which had
    eluded the eyes of other searchers. The Chronicles mention various
    dates in connection with the ancient city, but this added proof was
    needed to carry us over the threshold from probability into the realm
    of incontrovertible fact, just as the finds in the Sacred Well proved
    for us the veracity of the legends.</p>

  <p>“This date-stone does not by any means indicate that the city was
    founded in 600 A. D., but that this particular temple,
    whatever its purpose may have been, was built or dedicated at that
    time. Imagine some terrible catastrophe befalling the United States,
    wiping out all our people and leaving our cities to fall in ruins and
    become covered with forests with the passing of hundreds of years. Then
    imagine an archæologist, even one as mad as myself, digging into these
    ruins and coming upon that block of granite which now stands over the
    entrance to the New York Corn Exchange and tells us in unmistakable
    terms when the building was erected. His find would be of tremendous
    historical value—a definite date standing out clearly from the misty
    past. But still he would not know nor have any clear idea of the date
    of the founding of New Amsterdam and no clue to the interesting history
    of those sturdy Dutch patroons who first built a village at the mouth
    of the Hudson.</p>

  <p>“And so it is with my Sacred City. There is not in all the world a
    metropolis living or dead more mysterious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> more dowered with romance.
    Its age, its origin, even the racial identity of its builders, are
    each and all sunk in mystery so profound that I doubt if we shall ever
    fathom them.</p>

  <p>“I was so elated over my discovery that I at once promised double pay
    to each man for the month and declared that we would have a fiesta
    that all would remember for miles around and describe in later years
    to their sons. I tried to tell them how important was our find, but
    the double pay and the fiesta were much more eloquent to them than any
    words I could utter. I singled out the old Indian whose great, great
    grandfather had passed down the tale of the stone book. His face was
    as impassive as the faces of the stone gods about us, as befitted his
    dignity, but I could see it cost him a tremendous effort not to shout
    with glee and dance about like a small boy, and he gloried in the fact
    that he had not led me astray. Drawing his bent frame erect, he said,
    ‘Did I not say so and did my great grandfather ever lie?’</p>

  <p>“Careful measurements showed that the stone had been the lintel of the
    doorway. Each end had rested upon and was securely cemented to the
    heads and supporting upraised arms of the huge Atlantean figures, thus
    forming an integral portion of the main temple entrance. This is not an
    unusual Mayan arrangement and, as previously mentioned, there is in the
    Akzab Tzib, or House of the Writing in the Dark, a similar lintel but
    without a date.</p>

  <p>“A very long time must have elapsed since the abandonment of this
    temple. A seed of the <i lang="myn">chac-te</i> tree was carried by the winds or the
    birds and dropped in the entrance, a little to one side of the center.
    This tree is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> of extremely hard wood and it grows slowly. It grew to a
    sapling and at last into a big tree whose roots by their upward thrust
    toppled over the central portion of the façade. The lintel fell to the
    ground, but its fall was softened by the pile of powdered mortar and
    stone which had already sifted down, and fortunately the priceless
    relic was unbroken. Time passed; the big tree died and decayed. All
    this we know by the casts of the gnarled roots left in the grouting
    beneath the temple platform. Once again fertile Nature planted a seed
    under the tablet, carried to its earthy bed down under the fallen
    stones by some rodent or fruit-eating bat. And this was the seed of the
    <i lang="myn">yax-nic</i>—a tree as hard as iron and as long-lived as its predecessor.
    It too grew to great size and its roots tilted the stone tablet to one
    side and, finally dying, left its epitaph written in root-casts or
    molds. Again ever-vigilant Mother Nature planted a seed, this time of
    a tree of soft, quick-growing wood, and the roots encircled the tablet
    as in a mighty hand; and thus we found it when we cut down the tree.
    Fortunately, the previous trees, which exude an acidic sap, had done
    the tablet no harm and the last tree had by its clasp rather protected
    the tablet than harmed it. And how easily Nature might have contrived,
    with her cycles of life, for the destruction of this treasure!</p>

  <p>“The day passed and darkness came, but I could not leave the spot. I
    dismissed my Indians and took the photographic cloth from my camera and
    covered the tablet and then piled over it some pliant boughs of trees.
    But, like the youth who lingers over his adieus to his sweetheart, I
    uncovered the stone again and sat beside it until the moon was bright
    overhead. My vagrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> fancy carried me back over the centuries and I
    saw smooth highways crossing and recrossing, and along these highways
    populous cities with the towering outlines of massive temples and the
    carved edifices of kings and nobles. I could hear the soft, silvery
    laughter of women bearing water-jugs, as they met in groups along the
    tree-shaded avenues, and there were merchants and bearers of burdens
    traveling to and fro from the market-places, and resplendent warriors
    and haughty peers and solemn priests. And there was the scent of
    incense smoke and a high, clear voice was chanting the invocation to
    Kukul Can....</p>

  <p>“I was aroused by the voice of one of my Indians, a quaint fellow who
    always addressed me as Ah Kin (High Priest)—why I do not know. ‘Ah
    Kin,’ said he, ‘Master, the voices of the birds are stilled; your
    food is cold and untasted; I beseech you to come and eat.’ I arose
    and went with him, but I could not eat; and all night, as I tossed
    in my hammock, I saw the tablet and its every inscription as clearly
    as though it were actually before my eyes, and early in the morning
    I was back at its resting-place. That day we carefully raised it and
    replaced it firmly upon the heads and upraised arms of the impassive
    stone guardians—serene, majestic figures that have witnessed a mighty
    civilization and its passing into the dust of oblivion. Once again
    their arms hold the graven tablet as of old, but their mute lips which
    might tell so much are silent and in their changeless gaze is the
    haunting, immutable introspection of the Sphinx.”</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
      <span class="small">THE CONSTRUCTION OF MAYA BUILDINGS</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WHOEVER views the pyramids along the Nile is inevitably intrigued as to
    how they were built—how the massive stones were transported and placed
    in their elevated positions. And likewise at Chi-chen Itza one is bound
    to speculate as to how the heavy stone-work was transported from its
    quarries, how it was so intricately carved, and by what predetermined
    plans it was erected into buildings which have stood for centuries,
    defying tropical nature.</p>

  <p>I have found the Sacred City an absorbing topic upon which to ponder,
    fitting together the known facts and drawing upon imagination to piece
    in the gaps, until the mental picture of the building of its ancient
    temples is an unbroken fabric. My own visualization of the process
    of building a Maya temple is no doubt faulty in many respects, and I
    have no wish to precipitate an archæological controversy by claiming
    it to be hole-proof; I offer it merely for the sake of the reader who
    has not the opportunity to create his own vision of the subject from a
    first-hand view of these ancient edifices.</p>

  <p>Imagine an army of workers—a hundred, yes, a thousand times as many as
    would be employed in the erection of a great modern building,—short,
    squat, powerful, sun-browned men, sweating at their task of quarrying
    and moving huge stone blocks.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

  <p>In the quarries the blocks for the monolithic serpent heads, the column
    sections, and all the larger pieces used in the building are being
    channeled from the solid ledge rock, or from isolated boulders, by
    the <i lang="myn">pa-tunich</i>, or quarry master, and his many assistants. The ring
    of blows struck with stone or wooden mallets upon chisels tipped with
    flint or calcite attests their industry. Some workers do not use the
    mallet and chisel, but score the soft limestone ledge with flint-bladed
    hatchets, while others ply long wooden poles as wedges and levers. On
    the quarry floor the master stone-cutters are squaring and smoothing
    the rough blocks and laying against them, from time to time, their
    wooden gauges, satisfied only when the stones are smooth and square and
    of the right dimensions. Under the finished stones are inserted wooden
    rollers and about them are knotted cables made of fiber or of tough
    vines, and long lines of men grasp the cables and bend their backs to
    the task of hauling the big blocks from the quarry to the building site.</p>

  <p>Lines of men like toiling ants carry on their shoulders baskets of
    earth and stones. Slowly the terrace or substructure is built up to the
    first level, its sides faced with smooth stones, and each side bisected
    with a broad stairway. And up to this level is built an inclined
    roadway for the workers and their burdens. And slowly, up and up, grows
    terrace after terrace, each smaller than the preceding one, and the
    pyramid takes shape, leaving a flat stone platform at the top upon
    which the temple will be erected. Here the <i lang="myn">pol-tunich</i>, the master
    stone-mason, and his artisans are busy in the finishing of the stones
    and in their intricate carving. Flint-edged hammers are used to work
    the grosser outlines, but the finer details are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> worked out with more
    delicate implements—gouging-tools of flint and calcite and keen-edged
    chisels of polished nephrite. Such a chisel Don Eduardo dug up near the
    base of one of the temples.</p>

  <p>The finished stones, one by one, are dragged up the long inclined
    roadway, to the floor-level of the temple, and put into their places
    under the direction of the master builder. Stone upon stone, the walls
    take shape and the column sections are set in place. Then come the
    workers in mortar. Every crevice is filled and the column sections
    firmed into place with small stone wedges and thick lime mortar. With
    a cement-like plaster of sifted lime and white earth mixed with water
    and the juices of the <i lang="myn">chi-chibe</i> plant, the workmen fill each crack in
    the walls and columns and burnish it to stony hardness and exceeding
    smoothness.</p>

  <p>Next come the sculptors—men of renown, artists famed for their skill,
    who spend months and years with knives of obsidian, nephrite and
    flint chisels, and tiny cutting-tools of copper and calcite. At last
    the stone-and-mortar surfaces are covered with deep-carved masks and
    portraits and battle scenes and hieroglyphs and friezes, until scarcely
    a square inch of plain surface remains. With pencils of red <i lang="myn">chac-ti</i>
    wood and with soft-plumed brushes dipped in brilliant pigments the
    carvings are further adorned—various shades of brown, the blue-green
    of the sacred quetzal bird, the emerald of the forest, the azure of
    the cloudless sky, the ultramarine of the deep sea, the gold of the
    noonday sun, the velvet blackness of a cloudy night, twilight purples
    in the long shadows of trees reflected in the pool of the Sacred Well,
    the gray of aged stone that has battled for countless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> years with
    the elements; vermilion of the turkey-head blossom, the rusty hue of
    red-earth dust. From triple-vaulted roof to temple floor the colors are
    applied with consummate artistry.</p>

  <p>Speaking of the tools used by the sculptors, the finds of Don
    Eduardo throw a new light upon this previously puzzling subject.
    Many cutting-edges and rejects of flint and calcite have been found.
    Some archæologists have stated that chisels of metal were not used,
    and probably these were but little employed, yet from the Sacred
    Well were raised several small hard copper chisels. There can be no
    doubt, to judge from the shape and the marks upon them, that they are
    chisels. One of Don Eduardo’s most precious finds is a nephrite chisel
    discovered at the base of the Great Pyramid. Concerning it he says:</p>

  <p>“While working one day around the base of the Great Pyramid of
    El Castillo, taking measurements and digging below the surface
    accumulations to get at the base line of the structure, I came upon
    a curiously shaped fragment of worked stone—heavy, close-grained,
    and dark green in color. Closer inspection showed it to be the edged
    portion of a cutting-tool.</p>

  <p>“The unbroken tool must have been of the typical celt type, about six
    inches long and three inches wide at the cutting-edge, tapering to a
    rounded head. The part found was rather less than a half of the whole,
    but nevertheless the more interesting and important part because it
    contained the polished cutting-edge. It was an unusual find, indeed.
    Stone points and cutting-edges of local material, like flint and
    calcite, are not uncommonly encountered in favored places after heavy
    rains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> that wash away the earth covering and expose them to view, but
    tools fashioned from costly, imported material like nephrite were
    rarely used and were not carelessly cast aside when broken, for even
    the fragments had their value and could be worked over into smaller
    implements or into ornaments.</p>

  <p>“The location in which this broken nephrite chisel was found, no less
    than the chisel itself, has an antiquarian bearing. Here was not only
    an authentic museum piece, but testimony as to its use, for clearly the
    chisel was used in making the sculptures of El Castillo and was lost
    there in the course of the work.</p>

  <p>“Nephrite, or kidney-stone, was used in prehistoric, ancient, mediæval,
    and later times as a remedy for kidney diseases. It was taken, of
    course, in pulverized form. In prehistoric times nephrite was as
    needful to the skilled artisan as tempered tool steel is to the modern
    craftsman. Nephrite was found in lands far distant from the Mayas; and
    pieces of unworked nephrite were bartered and sold, as was nephrite
    dust. This dust packed on a rawhide surface became an effective
    abrasive for shaping and polishing the nephrite tool. Nephrite carried
    by ancient ways of commerce, by barter and trade and conquest and
    plunder, reached the Mayas to a limited extent. I have no doubt its
    value to these ancients was greater than that of gold.”</p>

  <p>Century after century has passed and the work of these amazing
    craftsmen still stands, even to the hair lines of the lintel carvings
    and the faint traces of pigment still clinging to the smooth walls. The
    epitaph is imperishable, even though the names of the artists, like
    their very bones, have vanished.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

  <p>Those who directed the work of temple-building not only built well,
    but had an eye to efficiency, also. No stone was wasted; rejects,
    fragments too small for carving or fashioning into building blocks—all
    were utilized as filling or ballast for the terraces. The stone chips
    from the mason’s hammer and chisel were used as grouting. Even the
    stone-dust was collected and sifted and mixed, in the ratio of three to
    one, with powdered lime, plant juice, and water, to make mortar. When
    the temple was completed to the point where the sculptors and painters
    took up their task, the inclined roadway was removed.</p>

  <p>Then when the massive temple, smooth-walled and roof-crowned, stood
    complete on its serrated pyramid of receding terraces; when the broad
    stairways were finished and the undulating stone serpents and the
    paneled terrace faces all were perfectly aligned and the whole majestic
    structure appeared as frosted silver against the velvet blue of the
    sky—then only did the master builder consider his work complete.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the Snail-shell or Watch-tower, all of the Maya
    buildings are rectangular. None are lofty, all are massive. Yet in
    all respects they are excellent in their architecture, of appropriate
    dimensions, symmetrical, and well constructed. Stones are fitted with
    infinite pains. Many have even been drilled. It has been shown that
    sharpened bird bones twirled about on the stone were employed as
    drills. Stones having drilled holes of six inches or more in depth are
    not uncommon. Mortar, plaster stucco, and cement were as good as or
    better than similar materials of the present time and were expertly
    applied. The use of pigments as understood by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> these ancient artisans
    is a lost art and it is doubtful if we have any colors as durable and
    unfading.</p>

  <p>Monolithic columns of great size, chiefly of serpent-head motif, are
    found everywhere. Built-up columns, both square and round, were used.
    Inlays, mosaics, and stone screens, bas-reliefs, full reliefs, murals,
    panels, cornices, balustrades, sills, lintels,—virtually the whole
    gamut of architectural design and embellishment known to the best of
    ancient or modern architecture,—were known and used by these builders
    isolated by two oceans from any foreign influence.</p>

  <p>Lintels were made of stone and of sapote, that iron-hard wood of
    Yucatan which defies the wear and tear of time like the teak of the
    Orient.</p>

  <p>In one respect Mayan architecture might be considered inexpert, from
    the standpoint of our present knowledge of building construction,
    and that is their method of roofing their structures and of building
    arches. Like the old Greeks, they did not know how to build an arch
    employing a keystone. Only by gradually receding courses of stone
    did they achieve an arch having a capstone instead of a keystone.
    The result, in the building of a roof, was a steep-pitched affair,
    comparatively low at the eaves and high at the peak. The vertical
    rise from eaves to peak was usually as great as the distance from
    floor to eaves. Being of stone, this roof was of great weight. Where a
    considerable expanse of roof was needed, the triple-vaulted arch was
    used. The Maya arch is not ungraceful, even though it is massive.</p>

  <p>In the Nunnery, or La Casa de las Monjas, we see successive stages of
    building where a part of an edifice is filled in with rock to provide
    a foundation for a superstructure <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>erected later. This, too, is a very
    common practice of the old builders and gives the impression that no
    very well-thought-out plans were employed. I think, however, that
    none of these buildings was built without a predetermined plan, which
    was probably drawn out upon some substance in great detail, so that
    priests and king as well as the builders knew the size and shape and
    mode of decoration before the building was started. Moreover, people so
    skilful at drawing and with so considerable a mathematical knowledge
    might surely have been able to produce in some simple form the plans of
    these structures. The stones are too well fitted, the dimensions of the
    buildings too well proportioned, the orientation too accurate to have
    been the result of chance. Everything bespeaks foreordination, careful
    planning carried through to completion.</p>

  <p>In several of the other ancient cities are found curiously carved
    stelæ, monolithic slabs of stone resembling the totem-poles of Alaska.
    These are elaborately sculptured with human figures and glyphs. Many
    are carved with amazing skill. In his book John L. Stephens describes
    a number of these stelæ and his descriptions are accompanied by
    the faithful drawings of Catherwood, made directly from first-hand
    observation and often with great difficulty. Frequently a small altar
    is found before these monuments. There is considerable reason to
    believe, from legend and the ancient Chronicles, that they were the
    date-records erected every twenty years, and if we could but read the
    hieroglyphs we might learn the important happenings in each score of
    years.</p>

  <p>From a close study of the architecture of the buildings and their
    decorations it is clear that there were several <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>stages of culture.
    Mayan architecture and art followed the rise and fall of the nation,
    becoming more and more refined up to the golden age represented in the
    temples of old Chi-chen Itza, gradually deteriorating in the newer
    temples, improving again under the influence of the Nahuatl conquerors,
    and sinking into utter desuetude several hundred years before the
    coming of the Spaniards.</p>

  <p>The story of the Mayas furnishes one more epic in the history of the
    human race; one more cycle of rise and fall; one more meteor flash
    of brilliancy followed by the darkness of oblivion. There have been
    in every part of the world similar instances of this groping toward
    knowledge and culture and their slow achievement, to be followed by
    decline and savagery, as though the life of a nation were a thing of
    nature which, like a tree or an animal, flourishes a brief while, then
    withers and dies.</p>

  <p>Is the twentieth century an exception to the age-old rule? Have our
    ability to commit our knowledge to the printed page and our great
    advance in the science of transportation set at naught the old rule? Or
    will our civilization also crumble with the passing of the years?</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
      <span class="small">STORY-TELLERS OF YUCATAN</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IN wet weather the archæologist may take either a well-earned rest or
    he may busy himself with cataloguing and packing the trophies of his
    trusty pick and shovel.</p>

  <p>“One day when the rain and the Evil Wind conspired to keep us indoors,”
    says Don Eduardo, “I found it much more interesting to listen to the
    yarns of the Indians than to work at routine tasks. All I can say in
    self-defense is that in Yucatan the subtle contagion of ‘mañana’ does
    get into one’s blood.</p>

  <p>“My Indians are all very superstitious. They believe whole-heartedly in
    witches and elves, and if one digs deep enough he finds a good deal of
    veneration for several deities not mentioned in the Bible. One of these
    is Balam, the jaguar, known in ancient times as the lord and protector
    of the fields.</p>

  <p>“These simple folk believe in ghosts which walk amid the ruins of the
    Sacred City, and they believe in all manner of fortune-telling and
    divination. They are particularly partial to crystal-gazing, using a
    crystal called <i lang="myn">zaz-tun</i>.</p>

  <p>“Among my Indians was Bat Buul, a little old fellow with twinkling
    eyes black as the seeds of the <i lang="myn">jabin</i> fruit, and ears that actually
    wagged when he became excited in telling a story. His big thick-lipped,
    sensual mouth was ever ready to laugh heartily at a joke, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> though
    the joke chanced to be on Bat Buul himself. Old as he was, he had still
    the supple quickness of a boy.</p>

  <p>“Bat Buul, whose name means ‘bean ax,’ was a native of the neighboring
    village of Pisté and he was famous as a raconteur in a land where good
    tellers of stories are highly esteemed. More often than not he was the
    hero of the stories he told, and as he warmed up to the telling, he
    would become tremendously excited and his black eyes would snap and
    burn with the intensity of his narration.</p>

  <p>“One of his best stories, that of the <i lang="myn">xtabay</i> or forest lorelei, has
    the sweet flavor of those wonderful old Greek myths of nymphs and
    satyrs and of gods come down from Mount Olympus for a holiday.</p>

  <p>“Often one sees glimmering gossamer flecks twisting, twirling as
    they scurry onward, aimlessly borne by a vagrant breeze. They look
    like a flock of diaphanous butterflies, but in reality they are the
    flying seeds of a climbing vine. The vine bears a slender, delicate,
    snowy flower and the seed-case is an olive-green oval pod filled
    with thousands of seeds. The seed mass is bisected within the pod by
    a light, silky membrane. As the ripening progresses the pod becomes
    chestnut in color and at last bursts open. The membrane with the seeds
    clinging to it falls out, but is brought up short in its descent by
    a thin filament that remains attached to the lower end of the pod.
    The fall detaches the seeds from the membrane, or they are soon blown
    clear, to be carried at the will of the wind. Each of the tiny seeds
    has a transparent wing or tissue.</p>

  <p>“Curiously, the two halves of the dried seed-pod are perfect natural
    combs, which are much used by native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> women, who believe that use of
    these combs supplied by Nature herself preserves the natural color and
    luster of the hair. The natives far and wide speak of them as the combs
    of the <i lang="myn">xtabay</i>—forest nymphs, dryads, or lorelei—and many, like Bat
    Buul, claim to have seen the nymphs combing their silken tresses. In
    the old days, also, the native belles used the combs, thinking thereby
    to capture some of the elusive beauty of the mythical forest maidens.</p>

  <p>“Before I proceed with Bat Buul’s story there is one other explanation
    necessary to a full understanding of the tale. Far in the hinterlands
    of Yucatan are Maya Indians still called the Unbaptized Ones and these
    natives wear always about their necks chains of gold and in their ears
    big hoops of gold wondrously adorned with filagree. The men, even
    more commonly than the women, wear these ornaments, which is strange,
    for among those natives who are at all civilized the men seldom wear
    ear-rings or neck-chains, though these adornments are popular with the
    women.</p>

  <p>“But the belief is common over the whole peninsula that by wearing a
    gold chain with a sacred relic or crucifix pendent from it one will be
    protected from danger. Men engaged in hazardous occupations such as the
    making of fireworks for fiestas and religious celebrations; butchers,
    and those who work with mad white men digging in haunted cities
    will tell you that such a chain is a potent charm against evil and
    sudden danger. Gallants occasionally wear chains of this sort, as do
    goldsmiths—rather out of vanity than for defense against ill-fortune.
    Always, when worn by men, the neck chains are hidden under the shirt.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

  <p>“Bat Buul, who, on his own admission, has tried his hand at almost
    everything, is a goldsmith by trade, a maker of rockets when and
    if these are required, and a beau gallant at all times. Naturally,
    then, he wears a solid-gold chain of extra length and weight, with a
    solid-gold cross at the end which has been blessed by the Archbishop of
    Yucatan in the cathedral of Mérida.</p>

  <p>“On this rainy day Bat Buul was resting luxuriously, ensconced upon a
    <i lang="myn">cauche</i> in the store of Monica, in his natal village of Pisté. As I
    entered the store after my three-mile ride in the rain from Chi-chen
    Itza, Bat Buul was holding forth to an eager group of listeners. In
    his hand was a thimble glass of that aromatic beverage <i lang="myn">xtavantum</i>
    and evidently it was not his first. He nodded to me as I joined the
    audience, but did not pause in his talk. It was evident that he
    determined to outdo himself for my benefit, being reasonably certain
    that if pleased, I would do the gentlemanly thing in the way of
    refreshment for all hands. As we would say in Americanese, ‘He was
    going strong.’ I give you his story as nearly as I can in his own words:</p>

  <p>“‘I, Bat Buul, am a man of great will-power. I say it—yes, and it is
    so. I am not large of body, but I am great of heart and very strong.
    There are those who have sought to prove my strength and they have
    found it to be so. I do not say these things boastfully, for only vain
    and cackling fools do that, and if I do say it, I am no fool. No man
    can deceive me long—no, and no woman, either. Many have tried, but few
    have succeeded, albeit most of those who have succeeded have been women.</p>

  <p>“‘But it is not given to man that he should be hard of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> heart and
    unbelieving toward women. No; many women have liked me; some have loved
    me, and because of this my heart is ever soft to all women; that is—’
    here Bat Buul swallowed an entire thimble tumblerful of the perfumed
    liquor and gazed at us benevolently—‘that is, toward all <em>handsome</em>
    women.</p>

  <p>“‘Well, sir, one day I started for the deepest part of the forest where
    I had some <i lang="myn">chac-ti</i> logs that I had cut and left to dry for charcoal
    which I needed to make powder for my rockets. I had nearly reached the
    point on the road to Chi-chen Itza where one turns to enter the deep
    forest, when I noticed that I was beside the place where grow the ghost
    flowers which come up in the night and wither in a day. I stopped for a
    moment to look at them, for have I not told you many times that I love
    the beautiful things of the forest? Then it was I heard a soft, sweet
    sound like the notes of a bird very, very far away calling to its mate
    or like a reed flute played by one who is sad.’</p>

  <p>“The old man paused and deliberately rolled and lighted a corn-husk
    cigarette. No one spoke. I have learned that it never pays to urge the
    native story-teller to get on with his narrative; story-telling is a
    rite which must be performed just so, and the artistic temperament
    resents any interruption not of its own making.</p>

  <p>“At length Bat Buul resumed:</p>

  <p>“‘I looked around me and saw a beautiful woman sitting under a tree.
    She was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen and she was crooning
    to herself, and all the while she was combing her long, shining black
    hair. Suddenly she looked up and saw me with her big, velvet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span> eyes
    that held a brightness like some deep, cool forest pool upon which the
    sunlight falls between the leaves. But she said nothing and continued
    to sing softly in that sweet, far-away voice of hers, while her rounded
    arms slowly rose and fell as the comb slipped through her glorious
    hair, so soft and fine that the little breezes one could scarcely feel
    rippled and floated its tendrils.</p>

  <p>“‘I went slowly closer to her and said quietly, in a way that I have
    of my own, “My handsome one, why are you out here so lonely and all by
    yourself?” I meant to say more, but she rose and moved a little away
    from me. Yet her eyes shone more brightly and she stopped singing and
    said ever so softly and sweetly, “Oh, Bat Buul!” Then she moved farther
    away. She was—how shall I say?—not thin, not fat, but plump like the
    wild partridge, and she moved as lightly as feather down. Yes, she
    seemed to float, so effortless was her retreat. Well, have I not said
    that my heart is soft toward a handsome woman? And so I followed her,
    even though she led me quite away from where my <i lang="myn">chac-ti</i> logs were
    drying in the sun.</p>

  <p>“‘She said nothing, but again began to hum a tiny, wistful, haunting
    melody and as she glided on she turned her head this way and that to
    glance at a plant or to inhale the perfume of a flower. And ever she
    kept an eye on me that seemed to invite me on and on.</p>

  <p>“‘Farther and farther we went from my logs, and deeper and deeper into
    the forest, and she seemed to grow more lovely at each step. Suddenly
    I found that I had walked right into a thorny clump of <i lang="myn">tynbins</i> and
    the <i lang="myn">tynbin</i> ants were swarming over me with their stings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> like the
    pricking of red-hot needles, while she, on the other side, was as cool
    and fresh as though she had but stepped from her morning bath.</p>

  <p>“‘And then I began to wonder, although the pain of the stings was
    very great. And when a man begins to wonder he is safe, for then he
    usually finds out why he is in trouble. “Ah,” I thought, “when I first
    saw this lovely maid she was sitting under a tree, combing her hair,
    and she called to me.” And I remembered it was a <i lang="myn">benote</i>, the tree
    that the <i lang="myn">xtabays</i> ever seek for shade as they sit and sing and comb
    their lovely hair and try to bring venturesome men to an awful death.
    “And so the Xtabay of Pisté has tried to play with Bat Buul this day.
    Poor thing! we shall see!” But all of this I said very softly to
    myself, for I am a wily man when dealing with women. Then, as if still
    unsuspecting, I worked my way out of the thicket. As she turned to
    elude me again, quick as lightning I slipped my long gold chain from
    my neck, hiding the crucifix in the palm of my hand. I know women and,
    after all, the <i lang="myn">xtabay</i> is a woman, and a good-looking one at that.</p>

  <p>“‘Then I stopped as if in surprise and said as I held up the chain,
    “I wonder who dropped this beautiful chain.” The <i lang="myn">xtabay</i> stopped
    singing and looked back at me. Just then a ray of sunlight touched the
    chain and made it glitter. And the sweet creature came up to me with
    unsuspecting curiosity and leaned close to look at the chain. Ah, I am
    the one who knows women! So quickly that she hardly saw the flash, I
    tossed the loop of the chain over her head so that it rested about her
    neck, and then held up the sacred cross so that she could see it. For a
    whole minute she stood perfectly still, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> she began to tremble. Her
    eyes filled with big, glistening tears and she looked at me piteously
    and said with a sighing sob, “Oh, Bat Buul!”</p>

  <p>“‘I felt sorry for her, for I am not heartless and she was one to melt
    even the hardest heart, <i lang="myn">xtabay</i> or no <i lang="myn">xtabay</i>. Yet I gave her only
    an unrelenting look and an answer that left her hopeless, for I said
    to her: “Things found by the roadside and unclaimed belong to him who
    finds them there. That is the law and the custom; and, pray, who is
    there to claim you from me?” She made no answer, but only bowed her
    head and cried the harder. Then I gave a little tug at the chain and
    said, “Come on home,” and she followed without a word of protest and
    with great glistening tears dripping from her lovely eyes.</p>

  <p>“‘And leading her in this fashion, I passed the big <i lang="myn">tanauha</i> where
    all the animals of the forest drink their fill even in the driest
    season. I passed the rock where little Pol Mis was slain by Ek Balam,
    the jaguar—black pagan that he is! And we came to the <i lang="myn">benote</i> tree
    with its green fruit like big arrow-heads standing sharp against the
    sky—the very tree where I first saw this entrancing nymph who now
    followed me like a dog on a leash. When we reached the tree she stopped
    and looked at me with pleading agony in her eyes, such a look as I
    never hope to see again upon the face of any woman and she said, “Oh,
    Bat Buul!” and then again, “Oh, Bat Buul!” and in her voice was the
    sound of strangled tears. A man does not like that sound, ever, for it
    either hardens his heart and makes him more cruel than he should be or
    it turns his heart to water and causes him to be more gentle than is
    just and right.</p>

  <p>“‘So I stopped and looked at her. I did not want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> to, but I could not
    help it; and as I looked I knew that she was more beautiful than any
    woman that ever lived, even though she were an <i lang="myn">xtabay</i> and without a
    soul, as the priest tells us. She was marvelously formed—not thin, not
    fat. Her flesh was as soft as a child’s, yet she was graceful and quick
    in her movements. She was all that a woman should be. She seemed like
    a bird just ready to fly. And, as I looked, I thought, “What will my
    friends say and what will the priest say and do?” Her eyes, filled with
    terror, pleaded with me more strongly than any words could have done.</p>

  <p>“‘Ah, Señor, I have the big heart! I took off the chain of gold and
    covered the crucifix in the palm of my hand and released her. For a
    moment she did not move and I thought she hesitated and looked at me
    as though she were really sorry to be free. I was a young man then and
    not bad-looking, and even an <i lang="myn">xtabay</i> may know what it is to love. She
    began to move slowly away, with light gliding steps. Then she stopped
    and said to me in the voice of the wood-dove talking to its mate,
    “Good-by, my Bat Buul.”</p>

  <p>“‘I could not move, but stood there spellbound and looked at her, and
    soon she reached the <i lang="myn">benote</i> tree where the shadows now lay thick and
    dark. Here she paused and looked at me long and tenderly; and there
    was no longer terror in her eyes, but, it seemed to me, only regret at
    our parting. And the sun, which was just slipping beneath the horizon,
    cast for a long moment a spell of gold that gleamed upon her glossy
    hair like the sheen of light on polished ebony or the glint of many
    tiny bits of bright metal; and this is queer, for her hair was like my
    <i lang="myn">chac-ti</i> wood after it has been burned very long.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

  <p>“‘Deeper and longer grew the shadows, and at last I could no longer see
    her. I leaned a little forward and I was conscious that I was breathing
    hard as though I had run a long distance, and still I seemed to hear
    faintly the low, sweet song that she had crooned when first I saw her;
    and at last even that faded into stillness. I do not know how long I
    stood there, but it was almost dusk when I turned to retrace my steps.
    I was a long way from home. As I slowly turned about, I saw something
    at my feet that shone like dark metal. It was the seed-pod of the
    <i lang="myn">xtabay</i> plant, which women sometimes use to comb their hair, and I was
    about to kick it carelessly aside when I heard a voice, “Oh, Bat Buul!”
    Just a whisper it was from far off in the forest. Then I knew it was
    <em>her</em> comb and I put it in my pocket, for she was a handsome woman and
    I could not throw the comb away. I have the comb to-day, although this
    happened long ago, when I was young and foolish.’</p>

  <p>“Bat Buul paused and sat very still, his eyes seeming to look beyond
    us and back into the past. He did not touch the refilled glass beside
    him, even though he knew that the patron was paying for it and that by
    drinking it speedily he might quickly obtain another. At last he said,
    with a twinkle in his eye and more to himself than to his audience:</p>

  <p>“‘I should like to see that <i lang="myn">xtabay</i> again; perhaps I should act
    differently. And, then, perhaps I should act the same, for my heart is
    still kind to women, especially if they are handsome women.’</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>“As I have said before, one of the most interesting things I have
    encountered in Yucatan is the native custom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> of story-telling. Usually
    the teller of stories is an old man or an old woman with a wide
    repertoire of folk-lore. Ghosts, giants, fairies; mythical animals such
    as white jaguars; miraculous humans, and the ancient gods—all appear
    in these tales, which are told with amazing skill. A little group of
    Indians will gather about the story-teller almost anywhere, in the
    courtyard of a house or in the public square of a town, and they will
    sit by the hour as the speaker goes on without pause from one weird
    tale to another.</p>

  <p>“I understand that in the near-by hamlet of Dzitas there is now a
    motion-picture theater and the telling of stories has been largely
    supplanted by the ‘movies,’ more’s the pity.</p>

  <p>“The children are, of course, eager for stories, and nearly every
    village has some kindly old woman willing to entertain the children
    with oft-told tales. Such was X’Leut Cauich. X’Leut Cauich was old,
    very old, and yet, even though the outer wrappings, the casings of her
    mind and soul, were wrinkled with age, her mind and seemingly her soul
    remained undeniably very young.</p>

  <p>“‘T is ever said that youth seeks youth as sparks fly upward, and the
    saying is a true one. Just so surely as old X’Leut seated herself
    comfortably before the <i lang="myn">koben</i>, or three-stone fireplace, in her
    <i lang="myn">na</i> (palm-thatched house) and started to make with colored threads
    and shining needle, on snow-white cotton cloth, the beautiful native
    embroidery “<i lang="myn">xoc-bui-chui</i>,” just so surely would the children of
    the neighborhood spring up as if by magic from the very ground about
    her and beg for a story. And old X’Leut, because she was a born
    story-teller, never dreamed of denying them.</p>

  <p>“Bit Euan; Phil Canul with his three brothers, all seemingly of an
    age; Pol Cocom with his big, soft eyes and harelip; Pablo Perez and
    his sister, white of skin, children of the Spanish storekeeper—all
    sat crouching, cross-legged, sprawling, each after the manner of his
    people, around old X’Leut, listening, motionless, with eager eyes and
    intent expression, to the words slowly spoken, clearly uttered, as they
    fell from her aged lips.</p>

  <p>“For them, and for old X’Leut as well, the outer world—the prosaic
    world about the palm-thatched <i lang="myn">na</i>—no longer existed—only the Wizard
    Potters as they worked, with swiftly moving hands and fingers, the
    magic clay, making the enchanted vessels of an ancient people.</p>

  <p>“She told them of Aluxob ‘The Little People,’ how they searched in
    the deep-down caves for the <i lang="myn">kat</i>, the <i lang="myn">kut</i>, and the <i lang="myn">ki</i>, the tiny
    crystals and the clays that the Wizard Potters used in the making
    of the ancient vessels. She talked with her eyes, her lips, and her
    hands. With agile feet alternately moving she showed how the ancient
    people revolved the shallow wooden disks as the potters of other lands
    work, with their hands, their revolving wheels. She told them of these
    vessels—vessels with magic worked into their very substance so that
    at night they changed into living things called Burro Kat and Hunab
    Pob; living things that tormented by their doings late night wanderers,
    thieves and drunkards; bad people generally; even children who,
    disobeying their parents, stayed out late at night or ran away from
    home.</p>

  <p>“Then, as X’Leut finished, rolled up her <i lang="myn">xoc-bui-chui</i>, poked the
    fire in the three-stone fireplace, and started the water to boiling in
    the earthen kettle, each man-child, introspectively brooding, hurried
    homeward to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> ask of his astonished mother if there was anything that he
    could do to put the house in order before night came. Ah! a guileful
    woman was old X’Leut, with her ever-young soul and nimble hand! A joy
    to the children and a solace to the tired mothers.”</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
      <span class="small">FORGOTTEN MICHAEL ANGELOS</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AS I have said, the art of the Mayas, and of Chi-chen Itza
    particularly, represents several periods of culture. Some of the oldest
    examples of architecture, stone point-work, carvings, and murals, as
    well as temple ornaments and personal trinkets display the greatest
    artistry of design and craftsmanship.</p>

  <p>Evidently art progressed until a golden age dawned, comparable in
    its way to the golden age of Greece. Just as Pericles and Praxiteles
    chiseled into stone a marvelous grace and beauty which later sculptors
    have never been able to excel, so these old Maya dreamers and creators
    have left behind them things more lovely than those of succeeding
    generations.</p>

  <p>Gradually the golden Mayan age waned. Creative genius became more
    scarce. Sense of harmony and soaring imagination were dimmed. Technique
    itself became poorer.</p>

  <p>And then came the renaissance—the period of Nahuatl influence when
    Chi-chen Itza probably reached its pinnacle of civic importance and
    new temples and palaces were built thick and fast. Art was encouraged
    and new genius arose, akin to that of the ancient masters, yet showing
    everywhere the influence of the Nahuatl invasion. But while the new art
    attained a high degree of excellence, it failed to reach the perfection
    of the older culture.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

  <p>It is rather difficult to assign to a given period any building as
    a whole, or any piece of workmanship, because the older city was so
    frequently robbed of its art treasures in the construction of the newer
    city. Columns and cut stones and lintels were torn from the older and
    perhaps then nearly ruined buildings to be used in the newer edifices.
    As in the House of the Writing in the Dark, we see a lintel of such
    extraordinary beauty as compared with the rest of the structure that
    it cries aloud its story of ravishment from a nobler and older temple.
    Apparently the later builders cared nothing for the beauty of this
    stone, but took it simply because in size it was appropriate for their
    purpose.</p>

  <p>In speaking of the three eras of Mayan culture in Chi-chen Itza, it
    is at least reasonable to suppose that the most ancient preceded the
    coming of the Itzas to the city; legend says there was a flourishing
    city here before the influx of the Itzas. The second period includes
    the rise and decline of art under the Itzas, ending with the
    Nahuatl-Aztec dominance. The third period approaches oblivion—the
    centuries following the decay of the Maya nations when “campers,” as
    Don Eduardo calls them, inhabited sparsely the old cities, and these
    people built nothing of permanence and despoiled much of the old art,
    knowing nothing of the past history and grandeur of the walls which
    provided a better shelter than they could build. The little of artistic
    merit which they created—if indeed, they created anything—is crude
    and inferior to the work of their ancestors. “Campers” probably lived
    in the Sacred City for two or three centuries preceding the coming of
    Montejo and until his advent.</p>

  <p>All that remains of the first period is the nearly obliterated <span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>old
    Chi-chen Itza, where future exploration may bring to light many
    treasures. Add to these the precious carvings that have obviously been
    taken from the old city for the building of the newer city.</p>

  <p>The second period is represented by the many temples and buildings,
    several in an almost perfect state of preservation, in the newer
    Chi-chen Itza, and the finds in the Sacred Well.</p>

  <p>The third period is represented only in the waste and debris left by
    the “campers” in and about the structures of the preceding periods.</p>

  <p>One striking characteristic of Mayan art is the skill of the ancient
    sculptor or painter in portraying the human figure and especially
    the human physiognomy. The faces in murals, friezes, and bas-reliefs
    are expressive, individual, full of character—the faces of men of
    intellect and purpose. Nearly always these portraits in stone or
    paint seem to have a sort of sublimity: an earnestness of mien, an
    inscrutability, and withal an utter lack of pompousness. None but
    great artists could so have caught the real character of the person
    portrayed. Mayan art is a decided step ahead of the art of the
    Egyptians, and beside it the Buddhas of the Orient seem insipid. There
    are, of course, grotesque figures and the many hieroglyphs which, it
    must be remembered, are not portraits but have been conventionalized
    into symbols far in advance of the original and more primitive
    picture-writing.</p>

  <p>One of the most intriguing things is the constant recurrence of the
    mask of Kukul Can, often conventionalized to fit the particular wall of
    a building, frieze, or mural where it is used. And always it is shown
    with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> long upturned snout which some casual observer has called an
    elephant’s trunk.</p>

  <p>To go a bit afield, G. Elliot Smith’s “Elephants and Ethnologists”
    takes up this subject of the elephant’s head. He believes that several
    elaborately carved columns or stelæ in Copan, another Mayan city,
    possibly more ancient than Chi-chen Itza, present credible pictures
    of elephants’ heads with the keepers or mahouts beside them. These
    carvings have caused considerable discussion; some stoutly maintain
    that they portray the elephant and others say the motif is derived
    from the tapir or from the head of the blue macaw. At any rate, the
    appearance is that of an elephant, but very likely is intended for the
    mask and nose of the great Maya hero-god Kukul Can.</p>

  <p>Of the many murals in the Sacred City, those in the Temple of the
    Tigers are the most interesting. On the opposite page is a reproduction [missing]
    of the scene on the west wall; it is from a tracing done twenty-five
    years ago by Teoberto Maier, of whom I shall later give further
    account. Much of the lower part of the mural has since been defaced
    by vandals or has chipped away through natural causes. The colors are
    vivid and the battle action enthralling. Of the many human figures no
    two are in the same pose. At the upper right is the Itza king or ruler,
    protected by his king of serpents spitting fire and venom at the enemy.
    A little lower down, and in front, is the chief Itza general with his
    protecting serpent, and all about are warriors armed with <i lang="myn">hul-ches</i>,
    darts, and shields. At the extreme left is the opposing general with
    his king of serpents and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> warriors.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Near the bottom at the
    left are the Itza notables holding a consultation, and at the bottom,
    center, is the time-keeper with his calendar wheel.</p>

  <p>Facing page 221 [missing] is an enlarged view of just a bit of this scene which,
    because of its larger size, gives a better idea of the technique of the
    painter.</p>

  <p>Another part of the battle scene, covering the east wall, depicts the
    invading army coming over the mountains to attack the Itzas. At the
    left in the picture is an Itza general or ruler, supported as usual
    by his beneficent Ahau Can or king of serpents. He is identified
    as belonging to the Itzas by his typical Itzan costume. The figure
    with the symbolized protecting serpent is similar to many others to
    be seen elsewhere in Chi-chen Itza, in paintings and bas-reliefs. A
    little lower down is his commanding general, also with a protecting
    serpent, and all about are the Itza warriors, now, due to mutilation,
    indicated only by the heads of their spears, pointing upward toward
    the enemy. In the upper right-hand corner of the painting is an Itzan
    horn-blower, standing upon a temple. His nationality is evidenced by
    the knee-protectors he wears.</p>

  <p>The invaders wear an entirely different style of clothing and their
    armament is not like that of the Itzas. For example, although they use
    the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>, their shields are rectangular—a shape never seen in
    Chi-chen Itza nor in the whole Maya area. Still more striking is the
    peculiarity of their head-dresses of three blue feathers with yellow
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>tips surmounting the regular feathered head-gear. It is significant
    that Don Eduardo, some years ago in the excavation of a temple,
    uncovered a gigantic painted head having a head-dress of three blue
    feathers with yellow tips. The stone containing the picture of the
    head was found upside down, and from the situation in which it was
    discovered it had evidently been so placed originally and had not
    fallen or been displaced. The reversed position of the head was the
    Maya method of conveying the information that this foe was conquered.</p>

  <p>Evidently the painting in the Tiger Temple was executed to commemorate
    the victory over the invaders of the blue feathers, and the other
    temple which Don Eduardo excavated also was decorated with murals that
    indicated victory.</p>

  <p>On each of the shields of the invaders is shown a curious red symbol
    which indirectly gives a clue to the nationality of these foreigners.
    In the central part of the state of Vera Cruz are found the remains of
    a highly cultured people, the Totanacs. The descendants of this ancient
    clan still reside in the neighborhood and their language contains many
    Mayan words. Because of the peculiarity of the design, as shown on the
    engraving of a clay Totanac facing page 225 [missing], there can be no doubt
    that it is the same identically as appears on the shields in the Tiger
    Temple. The same peculiar design occurs frequently upon the ancient
    Totanac sculptures and pottery.</p>

  <p>The Totanacs are neighbors to another tribe just to the north, the
    Huastecas, who spoke the pure Maya language and were a part of the
    Maya brotherhood. It seems probable either that they were left behind
    in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> great Maya migration from the west or that their country was
    originally the home of those Mayas who later emigrated to Yucatan under
    the leadership of the mighty Kukul Can.</p>

  <p>Either supposition might be correct, for it was in this locality that
    the now famous Tuxtla statuette was found which bears the earliest
    date ever discovered in this part of the world—113 B. C. The
    earliest date-stone in Chi-chen Itza is the one found by Don Eduardo
    and its date is more than seven hundred years later. During the
    interval between the two, or even before, the emigration to Yucatan
    from the west might have occurred.</p>

  <p>Another curious thing in the Tiger Temple painting is the fact that the
    invaders are shown coming over mountains. Northern Yucatan contains
    no mountains, not even a high hill. But in the state of Vera Cruz
    there are mountains. There is little to substantiate any theory that
    the people of the Sacred City invaded Vera Cruz and it is much more
    probable that the Totanacs were the invaders.</p>

  <p>In passing, another hypothesis of the ethnology of the Mayas is that
    they were descendants of the Toltecas, a peaceful and cultured people
    who inhabited Mexico proper before they were driven southward by the
    Nahuatl or Aztec tribes. In various places in Mexico, Toltecan remains
    have been found similar in construction and design to those in the Maya
    areas. Yucatan may have been the final stopping-place of these people,
    but as they moved ever southward, bands dropped out along the road, and
    settled.</p>

  <p>It is known that many years later Aztec soldiers marched clear around
    the rim of the Gulf of Mexico<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span> and through the jungles to Chi-chen
    Itza, which was their final destination. Their influence is very
    evident in the buildings in newer Chi-chen Itza.</p>

  <p>Because many of the murals in the Sacred City have reached the critical
    point of deterioration in the last decade or so, I have made a point of
    photographing as many of them as possible. Much of the photography has
    employed the color-separation process. All told, I have taken upward
    of a thousand photographs, and in addition I have made a large number
    of drawings or tracings where it was impossible to use the camera. A
    number of murals which were clear and perfect during my earlier trips
    to Yucatan, some eighteen years ago, are now entirely faded or chipped
    off.</p>

  <p>From a minute study of the paintings I am reasonably sure that the
    artists of this past age waited until the walls of a building were
    completed and the inner surface had been covered with a thin, hard
    stucco, then they painted the whole wall-surface to an even tone of
    color, usually a light olive green. Upon this the outlines of their
    pictures were sketched, either with red chalk or some soft red stone.
    The outlines were then intensified with a brush dipped in red pigment.
    From the character of the brush-marks I judge the brushes to have
    been made of hair or feathers. The next step was the laying in of the
    colors, the pigment being mixed with some sort of varnish that dried
    and permitted other colors to be superimposed.</p>

  <p>For example, take the figure of a man. After the outline was completed,
    the whole figure was painted flesh color. When this was dry, further
    outlining within the figure was done. Then another color was laid over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
    the shield, clothing, and other portions. Some details of the shield
    might then be ornamented with still another color, and another would be
    laid on the bosses of the shield and perhaps several colors put into
    the head-dress. Wherever the red outlines were painted over, yet were
    needed for completion of the work, new red outlines were painted in.</p>

  <p>Facing page 220 [Transcriber: missing] is the reproduction of a tracing
    I have made of a red outline, showing as faithfully as possible the
    beginning and ending of each brush-mark. It is in the same free-hand
    style used by the modern painter.</p>

  <p>Bas-relief work was much used in the Sacred City and for this type
    of art the cracks between the stone-work were filled in with stucco
    to give an even surface and then the whole surface was polished. The
    artist cut his designs into both stone and stucco. I cannot say how
    this work was laid out, but it is reasonable to suppose that it was
    outlined in red chalk and pigment much as murals were. The incised
    work is from a quarter to half an inch deep and the figures stand
    out boldly, especially when the direction of the light is from a
    particularly favorable angle.</p>

  <p>The projecting part of each relief was painted in identically the same
    manner as murals, one color after another being superimposed. A notable
    example of this type of art is found in the Temple of Bas-Reliefs,
    which is just back of the mound of the Tiger Temple, and is unique in
    the fact that it is situated upon level ground and not upon a pyramid.</p>

  <p>Of this building there is still standing the right wall, nearly all
    the back wall, a fragment of the left wall, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> about a fourth of the
    ceiling. The colors upon the bas-reliefs, with which walls and ceiling
    are covered, are quite clear except upon the left wall, where for some
    reason they are much faded but still distinguishable. On the ceiling
    the colors are remarkably distinct, especially several tones of blue.
    I recollect that my uncle, who painted the “Spirit of Seventy-Six,”
    once told me that blue is a fugitive color and that there is no such
    thing as permanent blue, which, he jokingly remarked, is the reason why
    painters use a pigment called “permanent blue.” The prevailing shade
    of blue used in these bas-reliefs is what artists of to-day would term
    indigo blue in various tones.</p>

  <p>Appropriate coloring has been used throughout. The flesh is
    flesh-colored; garments, war-gear, everything is properly colored. In
    these as in nearly all the bas-reliefs, the incisions or background
    are colored a deep red, originally, I judge, as brilliant as Chinese
    vermilion but now mostly faded to a brick red.</p>

  <p>These walls represent the very pinnacle of Maya art. There is nothing
    of antiquarian interest upon the American continents that excels or
    even approaches them. The figures are not stiff and unlifelike as
    are Egyptian figures. On the contrary, they are uncannily faithful
    portrayals of men in action. They are about three feet high, and on
    these walls are more than eighty figures of kings, gods, priests, and
    warriors. Many, particularly the priests, are clad in most wonderful
    and elaborate vestments. The warriors are more simply clothed and all
    carry <i lang="myn">hul-ches</i> such as were actually found in the Sacred Well. Upon
    the back of each fighting man is a quiver holding five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span> darts. Each
    dart bears the individual mark of its owner, so that if retrieved it
    might be returned to him.</p>

  <p>The bas-reliefs depict six different scenes, and each runs completely
    about the room. Separating each scene from the one above it is the
    conventionalized body of a great serpent.</p>

  <p>In all of this work I have discovered but one female figure. Below this
    figure is an ornamental border about eight inches high on which are
    engraved flowers and small human figures in curious acrobatic postures.</p>

  <p>The front portion of the roof is now fallen in, but I surmise that
    originally the illumination of the building was such as to bring out
    the relief work most prominently.</p>

  <p>At present one gets a much better impression of this work at about ten
    o’clock in the morning than at any other period of the day.</p>

  <p>In the National Museum at Washington, there is a reproduction of these
    bas-reliefs, but this modern work has scarcely caught the spirit of the
    old Maya artists. It should be the immediate aim of archæologists to
    preserve or duplicate the bas-reliefs in the most faithful manner, for
    the sake of posterity, for I doubt if we shall ever uncover anything
    finer in American antiquity.</p>

  <p>Teoberto Maler spent a great deal of time in making photographs,
    drawings, and tracings of the old Maya murals and reliefs, and the
    world owes him a debt of gratitude for the minute care he took and the
    faithfulness of his reproductions. Maler, who is now deceased, was no
    mean antiquarian. He was also an artist and a man of most peculiar
    personality.</p>

  <p>For several years his more or less undirected exploration <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>was done
    for the Peabody Museum, and then he fell out with the heads of that
    institution and thereafter worked as a free-lance. For years his
    livelihood was derived by selling information, photographs, and
    drawings to dilettant antiquarians. So many of these failed to pay him
    for such services that the poor fellow became suspicious of virtually
    every one who attempted to be friendly with him. I called on him four
    times before I could even get him to talk about archæology. But I
    always took several bottles of beer with me, so he became more cordial;
    and as I was especially careful not to question him in any way to
    indicate an interest in his work, he finally thawed out completely.</p>

  <p>An Austrian by birth, he had accompanied the ill-fated Maximilian
    to Mexico and had finally drifted southward into Yucatan, where he
    centered his interest on archæology.</p>

  <p>One day he presented me with about twenty photographs from his
    collection, which I was happy to have, although some were discards.
    Seeing the sincerity of my gratitude, he offered to show me some
    things which he said had never been seen by any one else. Among these
    treasures was his excellent tracing of the battle scene in the Tiger
    Temple. The next day I asked him with some trepidation if I might make
    a copy of the tracing. He was quite willing and when I suggested that
    I would travel to Mérida to get some tracing-paper for the purpose he
    produced a whole roll of it. I spent an entire week making this tracing
    and several others, Maler working beside me and helping for several
    hours each day.</p>

  <p>I tried to pay him when the work was completed, but he would never
    accept a penny, saying I was the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span> man who had ever come to him
    without trying to get something for nothing, and he repeated this
    remark, I have been told, to other people. He told me he trusted only
    two men in the world. Naturally, I was very glad to have won his regard.</p>

  <p>One day, some years later, he showed me several golden ornaments which
    I afterward found had come in some devious way from the Sacred Well. I
    fortunately made some photographs and drawings of them, for the next
    year, when I asked to see them again, Maier no longer had them. Some he
    had evidently sold to a museum abroad and the remainder he had disposed
    of otherwise.</p>

  <p>Maler had a foolish hatred for Don Eduardo and called him “falsifier
    Thompson,” but the latter had no such feeling toward Maler; in fact,
    one can scarcely imagine Don Eduardo’s hating anybody.</p>

  <p>During one of my visits Maler promised me that the following year
    we should make a two weeks’ journey into the interior of Yucatan,
    where he had discovered a temple unknown to the world which contained
    some marvelous murals. He said that he had discovered an underground
    entrance to the temple and when he left he had covered up the entrance
    and planted shrubbery over it so that it would remain hidden from
    archæologists. At that time I made a tracing of one of his drawings,
    showing a wall of this temple on which is depicted a water scene,
    with a volcano spouting fire and smoke, buildings falling into the
    water, people drowning, and a figure dressed like a warrior, paddling
    away from the scene, in a boat. Maler was a firm believer in the Lost
    Atlantis theory and contended that this picture represented <span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>the
    destruction of Atlantis. It was an obsession with him that nothing from
    this secret temple should come into the possession of what he termed
    “that infamous museum.”</p>

  <p>I shall always regret that Maler died before I was able to make the
    intended trip with him to this hidden temple, as the knowledge of its
    location died with him.</p>

  <p>Teoberto Maler, soldier of fortune, artist, archæologist, and eccentric
    misanthrope, yet at heart kindly and lovable, died of a fever three
    years ago, in his adopted land of Yucatan. All of his personal
    belongings were taken over by the Austrian consul, and I am told that
    except for his numerous photographs and drawings there was nothing
    among them of value.</p>

  <p>Among the modern inventions which the antiquarian has to be thankful
    for, place first in the list the camera, which makes possible faithful
    reproductions, frequently under most unfavorable conditions. Compare
    modern photography with the difficulties that beset Catherwood, who
    made the exceptionally fine engravings with which Stephens’s books are
    illustrated. Catherwood did his work nearly eighty years ago, using a
    “camera obscura,” a rather clumsy device which projects an image on a
    screen so that it may be traced. In making a single tracing Catherwood
    worked for hours at a stretch in the tropic heat, beset by insect
    pests, whereas to-day a few moments with a camera would be sufficient.</p>

  <p>One of the interesting things shown in the old murals and bas-reliefs
    is the diversity of costumes. The dress of the figures varies from the
    simple wide belt, with flaps hanging down front and back, to the very
    elaborate vestments of the priests. To the belt might be fastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
    armor of heavy quilted cotton or of wood or even of metal.</p>

  <p>The costume of the warrior always included an ornate feathered
    head-dress and there was wide variation in these head-ornaments. In
    some cases they were made of wood in the shape of a bird or other
    animal and the surface was covered with a thin layer of metal such
    as beaten copper or gold or with well-tanned deerskin or of finely
    woven cotton fabric embroidered with feather-work. From the top of the
    head-dress, feathers sometimes descended in graceful curves clear to
    the ground. The entire head, wings, and tail of a bird were often a
    part of the head-gear. The head-gear of kings and nobles was decorated
    with the feathers of the sacred quetzel, or bird of paradise. On a few
    of the pictured head-ornaments, one or more serpents’ heads are seen,
    and these may have been a symbol of rank or the coat of arms, so to
    speak, of a certain family. In other cases the front of the head-piece
    shows the face or mask of some deity, often the face of Kukul Can.</p>

  <p>Fastened about the warrior’s neck is often a cape of cotton fabric
    so heavily embroidered with feathers that it appears to consist of
    feathers alone. Some of these capes or tunics are covered with metal
    scales to ward off the thrust of spear or dart. The Maya love of finery
    is indicated by the ubiquitous string of jade beads about the neck,
    ending in a heavy jade pendant or medallion. Such beads are worn by
    many of the pictured figures.</p>

  <p>Around the warrior’s waist is a wide, embroidered belt supporting an
    ornamented apron. Protectors of feather-work surround the knees, and
    upon the wrists are curious wristlets. Sandals are made of deerskin or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
    heavy felt and are decorated with geometrical figures; they are laced
    in front and frequently have high sides like a shoe. Both deerskin and
    felt sandals have been found in the Sacred Well. A band is worn around
    each ankle, with feathers projecting from the front. This band is
    purely decorative and has no connection with the sandal.</p>

  <p>Usually the fighting-man is shown either holding five darts in his left
    hand or having that number of darts in a quiver on his back. In his
    right hand he grasps the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i>.</p>

  <p>Some of the figures have their arms almost entirely obscured by bands
    covered with feathers. Other figures wear cloaks or mantles fastened
    at the throat and reaching nearly to the ground. These are generally
    embroidered heavily with the feather-work so dear to the ancient Mayas.</p>

  <p>Figures are also shown wielding the formidable spear tipped with flint.
    Some of the spear-heads taken from the Sacred Well are from eight to
    nine inches long and two to three inches wide, and razor-edged. Spears
    were usually gaily decorated with feathers attached to the shaft where
    it joined the head. In the bas-reliefs is shown, also, a spear-head
    with serrated edges. For fighting at close quarters the battle-ax was
    used. It consisted of one or several stones or of a metal blade fitted
    into a wooden helve.</p>

  <p>In addition to the armor worn there were shields. Some of the shields
    were built to fit closely the back and sides of the warrior and
    were fastened to the broad band of his belt. Other shields, carried
    in the usual manner, were made and ornamented in several different
    ways. Usually the base was wood, embossed with metal, studded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> with
    jewels or ornamented with feathers. I was fortunate enough to be
    with Don Eduardo at one time during the dredging of the well and had
    the thrill of picking from the muck of the dredge the golden section
    of a shield-front, which had been a large round ornamented disk of
    considerable size, embellished with carvings of flowers and scrolls.</p>

  <p>The net also was used in battle and, as shown in the bas-reliefs,
    was carried by the spear-thrower, in his left hand. Very likely it
    was effective in stopping the thrust of a spear. Or—who knows?—it
    may have been used to entangle the enemy in the manner of the Roman
    gladiator armed with net and trident.</p>

  <p>The warriors went into battle to the resounding blare of horns, and
    trumpets were used to signal troops in action. There were whole
    companies of horn-blowers, each man provided with a horn nearly as tall
    as himself. Horns and horn-blowers are clearly shown in the murals of a
    second-story room in La Casa de las Monjas.</p>

  <p>Our information obtained from a study of the bas-reliefs and murals
    and from the articles retrieved from the Sacred Well and other finds
    checks with remarkable closeness the writings of Landa, whose sources
    of knowledge were chiefly legend and the old Maya writings. Landa says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>They had for their defense round shields which they made of
      split reeds woven round and adorned with deer-skins. They had
      jackets padded with cotton and filled with salt. These were of
      two thicknesses or layers of padding and extremely strong.</p>

    <p>Some of the chiefs and captains had helmets of wood. They went
      to war with plumage and tiger and jaguar skins on—those that
      had them. They always had two captains, one hereditary
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> and
      perpetual, the other selected with much ceremony for a term of
      three years.</p>

    <p>On the roads and passes they erected defenses of twigs and wood
      and sometimes of stone for their archers.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> If they captured
      some distinguished man, they sacrificed him, because they did
      not want to leave alive anyone who might later harm them.</p>

    <p>They had hatchets of certain metal which they fastened into
      handles of wood and these served them as arms and also as
      instruments to cut wood. These they sharpened by pounding with
      a stone to harden them as the metal was virginally soft. They
      had small, short lances with points of hard flint.</p>

    <p>In their earth there was not discovered until now any kind
      of metal with which they might make implements with which to
      work on their numerous edifices. However, not having metals,
      they found in the earth flint with which they made materials
      for their lances which they used in their wars; and the knives
      for sacrifice were made from flint which the priests had
      selected.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

    <p>They had a certain kind of white brass with admixture of gold
      from which they made their hatchets for different functions and
      also hawk-shells and a certain kind of small chisel with which
      they made their idols. The brass and other plates of metal and
      hard copper plates they used to barter for things from Tabasco
      for their idols, trading back and forth.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the illustration following page 241 may be seen the more elaborate
    costume of the priests. This illustration of a small section of the
    back wall of the Temple of the Bas-Reliefs represents a religious
    ceremony. The whole wall is covered with figures of priests and
    warriors paying devotion to Ahau Can, the king of serpents.</p>

  <p>The Great Serpent looms majestically over and about <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>the high priest,
    who is decked in gorgeous apparel. Mask and helmet cover his face and
    head, and from his body intricate scrolls extend in all directions,
    denoting the words or chant to which he is giving voice. In his hand
    he holds a shield over the surface of which the body of the protecting
    serpent undulates. From the mouth of the Great Serpent issue scrolls of
    red and yellow, which may be words or venom.</p>

  <p>Perhaps one may realize from this sculpture how keen was the decorative
    sense of these ancient people. It was ever seeking an outlet for
    expression. The undecorated space on wall or ceiling must have seemed
    to the Maya artist an inartistic space. He crowded his areas with
    ornamentation, yet with so nice a balance, so true a harmony that he
    achieved a perfect result without giving an impression of congestion.</p>

  <p>Other figures show the use of ear- and nose-ornaments and of labrets
    made of thin disks of gold and of highly polished jade.</p>

  <p>Finally, there are the wonderfully worked ornaments of fine flint,
    flawless and shaped curiously like the parts of a bishop’s crozier.</p>

  <p>In the Tiger Temple is a frieze near the top of the wall, extending
    clear around the four sides, which shows a procession of jaguars. It
    is a thing of sheer beauty, for the artist has caught in his paintings
    the very nature of the beast. There he is, in all his slinking, lithe,
    feline ferocity, conventionalized but losing nothing of his character.</p>

  <p>Above and below the row of jaguars is an ornamentation of
    conventionalized serpent motif which is graceful, accentuating the
    litheness and grace of the huge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span> cats. The whole frieze is done on a
    surface of stone polished to such smoothness that it conveys the idea
    of white marble worked by the hand of an old Italian master.</p>

  <p>Another remarkable mural was upon a stone which was found by Sylvanus
    Morley in the debris of a partially ruined temple in old Chi-chen Itza
    which he named the Temple of the Owls. It is so named from the fact
    that many of the fallen columns bear sculptures of owls. For a number
    of reasons I believe that this is one of the earlier temples, built
    when Maya art was at its best, and I was thrilled at the quality of
    workmanship on the stone. The colors were much faded and the entire
    picture too faint for the camera. I found first, in cleaning the
    corners or unimportant parts by washing in water, that the paint would
    stand almost any sort of gentle rubbing. In fact, the only way it could
    be destroyed was by scraping it off with an edged tool. Washing showed
    that the colors were somewhat more vivid when the stone was wet and it
    occurred to me that it could be treated in much the same manner as an
    old oil painting, which may be greatly revivified by cleaning and then
    applying a coat of varnish.</p>

  <p>Acting on this assumption, I first cleaned the stone with a weak
    solution of hydrochloric acid, which had no effect on the pigments
    but did remove much dirt. The next question was varnish. I had some
    turpentine and a few other chemicals but no varnish. And then I thought
    of the copal incense that Don Eduardo had taken from the Sacred Well.
    I took a ball of this and scraped off the calcined outer surface. The
    remainder of the copal I broke up and placed in an earthen bowl which
    also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span> came from the well. Then I added a little turpentine and heated
    the mixture over a slow fire until the copal was melted. Finally I
    strained the liquid through a piece of cloth and had an excellent
    transparent copal varnish. I tried it out on several unimportant stones
    and found that it gave a fine surface gloss. I then applied it very
    carefully to the painted stone I had discovered, first to the blue
    border and then to the whole surface. I was overjoyed, when the varnish
    had dried, to find the colors magically restored, several of them
    being nearly as bright, I think, as when originally applied, perhaps a
    thousand years before.</p>

  <p>It was now a simple matter to obtain excellent photographs and I took
    several, both in black and white and with color separations.</p>

  <p>This stone, which I named the Stone of Kukul Can, told a complete
    story. It represented the long-nosed god, the particular deity of the
    Sacred City, emerging from the mouth of a serpent, just as shown in the
    old Maya books and in many other places. In other words, it depicted
    the birth of Kukul Can, the feathered-serpent god. Below the serpent
    and the figure of the god was shown the bowl of the earth, or the
    archaic representation of the earth. Here and there were cacao pods,
    from which was obtained chocolate—then as now an important article of
    food, a highly prized delicacy among the Mayas and other races. Cacao
    is one of the fruits the Mayas thought to have been brought them by
    Kukul Can.</p>

  <p>The god held in his hands emblems of life and generation. Above
    were the celestial heaven and the zodiac. At right and left were
    the hieroglyphs of the sun and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> planets. On the upper margin was an
    inscription. The whole was majestic and exquisitely done. It indicated
    all of the good things of life,—prosperity and plenty,—bestowed upon
    his people by the mighty god Kukul Can, born of a serpent.</p>

  <p>When I had finished photographing and studying this extraordinary
    stone, I wrapped it carefully and stored it in Don Eduardo’s hacienda,
    where it was later ruined when the hacienda was burned by unruly
    Indians.</p>

  <p>This lost stone was an excellent example of the older and finer Maya
    art and a careful comparison of it, as photographed, with the pages
    of the Perez Codex, one of the few remaining ancient Maya books (now
    in the National Library in Paris), shows its similarity to the work
    therein displayed. The portraits of Kukul Can are identical. The
    hieroglyphs have the same peculiarities of shading, due to the stroke
    of the brush being heavier on one side than on the other. If the artist
    who painted the Stone of Kukul Can did not also illuminate some of the
    Maya books, he at least belonged to the same period and the same school
    of artists. I am sure that the great work of Mr. Morley of the Carnegie
    Foundation, which is now going on at Chi-chen Itza, will uncover many
    more stones similar to this one and it will be demonstrated that many
    of the Maya books were produced in the ancient city.</p>

  <p>Very frequently in the murals or the bas-reliefs, where figures of
    men are shown, the glyph representing the man’s name appears above
    his portrait. Thus we have “Mr. Can,” or, in English, “Mr. Snake,” as
    in the second cut opposite page 112 [missing]. Above him is the carving of a
    serpent. This gentleman has the conventional nose- and ear-ornaments
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>and over his head is the double feather of a warrior. From his mouth
    issues a scroll representing speech. Other figures are “Mr. Duck,” “Mr.
    Phallus,” etc.</p>

  <p>In one of the Codices is shown an eclipse of the sun. It is remarkably
    well drawn in colors.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> At the top of the page is what may be called
    the text, which we are not able to read although we know many of the
    characters. Directly below is the celestial band, representing sun,
    moon, and planets. Dependent from this band are three hieroglyphs of
    the sun in the heavens. The central figure is the sun, and wings at
    left and right mean movement of that body, or day and night. Under each
    of these figures is a bird in the act of devouring the sun. The word
    for eclipse in Maya is <i lang="myn">chi-bal-kin</i>, literally “mouth-action sun,”
    or “bitten sun,” and it was the ancient belief, which persisted until
    fairly recent times, that at the time of an eclipse the sun was bitten
    by a serpent or by birds or other creatures.</p>

  <p>Beneath each picture representing the devouring of the sun are the
    date-glyphs.</p>

  <p>An interesting colored mural from the ceiling of La Casa de las Monjas
    shows a warrior standing upon a pyramidal structure. In his left hand
    is the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i> and in his right a shield and battle-ax. He has just
    shot two lances to which are fastened firebrands, which have passed
    over a walled inclosure and are intended to set fire to the buildings
    within. In one corner of this picture is a building representing the
    Iglesia (one of the annexes of the Nunnery) or a similar structure,
    as denoted by the mask of Kukul Can sticking out from the wall of the
    building. In the foreground, at the left, is a mammoth head-dress,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>which may be explained by the fact that it was not uncommon for the
    Maya artist to make a picture and then to introduce into the foreground
    large figures entirely out of proportion to the remainder of the
    picture.</p>

  <p>As for full-relief carving, one need only see the serpent columns of El
    Castillo or the Tiger Temple, and the serpent balustrades, to know that
    the Maya artists were fully as skilful at such work as in producing
    bas-relief and murals.</p>

  <p>Among the pottery, incense-burners, and funerary urns discovered at
    Chi-chen Itza are frequently exceptionally fine examples of ceramic
    art. A vase of a substance like alabaster found by Don Eduardo is a
    thing of matchless beauty.</p>

  <p>Of metal-work in gold and copper there are many pieces indicating
    great skill and artistry. Jade ornaments such as beads and plaques are
    exquisitely worked and perfectly polished.</p>

  <p>Of stone point-work, heads of darts and spears, and blades of
    battle-axes, as well as cutting-tools and weapons, nothing has been
    found in America which can compare to the Maya work. The sacrificial
    knives found in the well are peerless in their artistry.</p>

  <p>The art of the Mayas shows the greatest variety in media, style,
    and technique. Even casual observation of that in the Sacred City
    shows that many different painters and sculptors were employed; yet
    everywhere painted or carved figures are natural, true to life, the
    proportions perfect. The best are comparable to those of ancient
    Greece; the worst, though crude, are never stiff and mechanical like
    those of Egyptian art.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately there are no statues like the Memnon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span> of Thebes nor the
    Apollo Belvidere, for the Mayas did not produce statuary or monolithic
    carving, with the few rare exceptions of Chac Mool figures and serpent
    columns. Rather their effort was toward detail and precision of figure
    and design. Some of the carvings are so minute that they are hard
    to see easily without a magnifying-glass. We can only wonder at the
    exceptional ability of this ancient people to originate, imitate, and
    express in stone or pigment or by the goldsmith’s or the lapidary’s
    art.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
      <span class="small">THE TOMB OF THE HIGH PRIEST</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">JOSÉ ALVARADO, once a common mine laborer, an ordinary peon, became the
    Silver King of Mexico, so fabulously rich that he offered to pay off
    the whole national debt of Mexico. His offer was declined by Porfirio
    Diaz, then President of Mexico. Alvarado inherited from a hard-working
    father a meager silver-mine and he took up the arduous working of this
    mine upon the decease of his parent, gaining from his toil scarcely
    enough to pay for his scant frijoles, chiles, and tortillas, until
    chance led him aside and caused him to strike his crowbar into an
    obscure cliff, a mountain of virgin silver.</p>

  <p>“Some of my finds in the Sacred City,” says Don Eduardo, “have been
    as much a matter of sheer chance as that of José Alvarado. And if the
    truth be told, I fancy a good many pioneer operations, scientific
    or otherwise, depend largely on Dame Fortune—or Lady Luck, as I
    understand she is now called in the States.</p>

  <p>“Earlier in life I gave rather less credit to chance and more to
    scientific deduction, and once I made a discovery in the Sacred City
    which followed so closely my calculated prediction that I concluded
    I had evolved a formula which, so far as this special class of
    work was concerned, would eliminate chance entirely. I went at the
    work of excavation with a new vim and mounting enthusiasm. It was
    hard, back-breaking toil for me, digging and heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span> lifting, yet
    I was sure of my diagnosis, certain of final triumph. I kept on
    digging,—endlessly, so it seemed, but with hope unflagging,—until
    suddenly I brought up against a solid ledge of living rock. It could
    not be explained away. To me it seemed to say, ‘Well, here I am
    and here I have always been, and your wise deductions, your clever
    calculations—where are they now?’ And to prove to me further that I
    must not ignore the little gods of chance, as I returned dejected and
    crestfallen along the deep trench, my crowbar accidentally struck a
    projecting limestone fragment which fell to the bottom of the trench,
    disclosing a dark cavity, within which were a rich find of pottery and
    a most interesting skeleton. But for the chance dislodgment of the
    stone, I should have missed the object of my search.</p>

  <p>“While I was engaged in some excavation in the building called
    Chich-an-chob (literally, “The Strong, Clean House,” called now the
    Red House) a small but unusually high mound to the southwest of the
    building was often in my line of vision. Although I could only guess
    at its outline through the thick growth of tall trees and matted vines
    that covered its sides, the little I could make out of its peculiar
    form excited my interest and kept it in my thoughts.</p>

  <p>“Eventually the progress of the work brought me to it and I had the
    opportunity to obtain at least an approximate idea of its structure.
    I found it to have been originally a small but well-built shrine or
    temple crowning a steep-terraced pyramid, but now converted by time
    and disintegration into a mere conical mound. The greatest factor in
    the decomposition of the shrine, as in the case of many others, was
    not wind and weather but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span> the wrenching apart of the stone-work by the
    growing roots of trees.</p>

  <p>“The temple itself was similar in plan to the great edifice which
    towers above Chi-chen Itza. In fact, it was El Castillo in miniature
    but differing in several important details, among which were corner
    and lateral stelæ or carved stone monuments, the rear ones bearing
    inscriptions which seemed to place the shrine in a different category
    from any of the other buildings I had examined in the Sacred City. Like
    huge El Castillo, this miniature temple has a main stairway facing the
    northeast, and similarly the approach is guarded by twin serpent heads,
    each a finely carved monolith. Protruding from the massive heads
    are forked tongues extending for some little distance. The serpent
    bodies, conventionalized into wide, flat bands, serve as balustrades,
    extending one on each side of the wide, steep stairway, clear to the
    temple platform. The big blocks of stone and masonry, fallen from the
    temple level, had rolled down these stairs and carried away most of the
    stairway, leaving just enough of the handsome, carefully cut steps and
    balustrade to indicate what had once been a perfect thing. Indeed, the
    stairway is no longer usable, although a few of the steps remain in
    place, and the difficult ascent is made by grasping projecting roots of
    trees and stone fragments and treading in the gashes left in the mound
    by the avalanche of rock masses from above.</p>

  <p>“Gaining the crown of the pyramid, we found there massive serpent
    columns corresponding to those encountered on the plain below. Well
    carved, artistic, they were half buried in the fallen walls of the
    temple, while one of the impressive capitals of the now famous serpent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
    columns, consisting of the conventionalized rattles of the rattlesnake,
    lay precariously balanced on the very edge of the platform. Its twin
    companion had long since crashed down the steep incline and its great
    bulk lay amid the debris and matted growth at the base of the mound.</p>

  <p>“In clearing away the forest growth and surface accumulations on the
    top of the mound, we uncovered the capstones of four large square
    columns which had once supported the triple-vaulted arched roof of the
    inner chamber. These capstones indicated by the almost effaced carvings
    on them that the columns beneath probably were covered with carvings.
    Believing these to be of real importance, as well as a safe guide to
    follow in the work of excavation, we began carefully to clear the space
    about them, and as fast as the column faces were cleared and cleansed
    I made plaster casts or molds of their wonderfully carved surfaces.
    When we at last reached the floor-surface of the chamber, we gave these
    ancient columns an opportunity to dry out thoroughly, after their
    centuries of accumulated dampness, before we continued work in their
    vicinity.</p>

  <p>“Being a dyed-in-the-wool New England Yankee as well as an antiquarian,
    I have, naturally, evolved some mechanical aids for my particular line
    of work in the thirty years I have been at it. Among these contrivances
    is an instrument which has proved most useful in detecting subterranean
    cavities near the surface. The device consists of an octagonal bar of
    steel with a tuning-fork at one end. The other end flares out into a
    protuberance like the bulb of an onion. By tapping with this crude
    instrument, using it as long experience has taught me, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span> have often
    been able to locate burial vaults and other cavities which I might
    otherwise have overlooked.</p>

  <p>“After the floor of the shrine had been cleared I sounded the whole
    area with my steel stethoscope and it indicated a large, deep cavity
    about midway between the first line of columns.</p>

  <p>“The floor was made of heavy cut stones, smoothly joined, and with our
    simple tools it was something of an undertaking to loosen and remove
    one of these large blocks. But at last we did raise it and found,
    beneath, a square cavity about four feet wide. At first the depth
    could not be determined, because the cavity was completely filled
    with crisscrossed roots. None was thicker than a pencil and most were
    thread-like, but all were so intertwined that they virtually formed a
    solid mass. My helpers looked doubtfully at this yellow, spongy mass of
    unknown depth. ‘Who knows what strange underground poisonous creatures
    may be hidden in this sickly mass of yellow and brown?’ they asked.</p>

  <p>“A stout pole was laid across the cavity and a rope tied to it so
    that it dangled down into the hole. Finally two of my bravest workers
    were persuaded to descend the rope, each clinging to it and wielding
    a dexterous machete with his free hand, hacking away at the spongy
    mesh of roots. Hardly had they warmed to the work when one of them, in
    heaving up a root mass, found himself covered with large red scorpions.
    Angry at being so rudely ejected from their habitation, they crawled
    over him with upraised, menacing tails, and several did sting him.
    Both men came popping out of the hole in record time and I at once
    administered antidotes, from my medicine case, to the man who had been
    stung and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>sent him back to the plantation house for the remainder of
    the day. Another man took his place and the work proceeded, but more
    cautiously.</p>

  <p>“We had just about finished getting out the root masses when there came
    from the cavity two terrified yells and two even more terrified men.
    When they had quieted down enough to talk intelligently they said that
    after cutting away a root mass, the last one on the bottom, and tying
    it to the rope so that those above might raise it, they had perched on
    a projecting ledge and lighted cigarettes, waiting for the rope to be
    lowered again. As it came down between them and rested on what they
    supposed was the bottom of the pit below them, they saw the bottom
    heave into a writhing mass and out of it rose the head of a big snake
    with shining eyes and jaws that yawned at them wickedly. As one man
    they climbed the rope and scrambled into the open. I think they would
    have rolled down the side of the mound and kept rolling right up to
    the plantation house if I had not grabbed and held them. Eventually
    their fright subsided and was replaced by curiosity and they stayed on
    willingly enough.</p>

  <p>“Nobody seemed particularly anxious to go down into the pit, so I
    thought it might be just as well to make some long-range observations
    before starting any hand-to-hand encounter with whatever was down
    there. A reflecting mirror threw a shaft of clear, strong sunlight into
    the well or shaft and my field binoculars, adjusted to a short-distance
    focus, revealed to me the coiled body of an amazingly large snake. As
    the shaft of light played about, the big fellow raised his head, waved
    it uncertainly, and then dropped it again. To judge from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> the size
    of the head and the shape of the body, the snake evidently was not a
    crotalid, or rattler, but rather some species of boa. Boas are not very
    difficult to handle, especially if you would just as soon have your boa
    dead. This particular representative of the boa family was, apparently,
    sleeping off a hearty meal and was still rather torpid, and it was no
    trick at all to kill him.</p>

  <p>“When brought to the surface, the deceased proved to be a <i lang="myn">chaib</i>, a
    kind of boa noted for its beautiful skin, handsomely marked with large
    mottles—greenish yellow and chocolate brown. Our victim was fourteen
    feet long and had a maximum diameter of eight inches. From his skin,
    native tanners made me a money-belt and a very comfortable pair of
    slippers. The <i lang="myn">chaib</i> is not poisonous and I have never heard of a case
    where a human being has been attacked by one as South American and
    African boas are said to attack. Nevertheless this snake bears an evil
    reputation among the Mayas, who believe that a nursing mother crossing
    its path becomes powerless in its coils and that the reptile sucks the
    milk from her breasts, though it does not otherwise harm her.</p>

  <p>“After disposing of the snake we resumed operations in the shaft. We
    discovered that some emanation of a gaseous nature or perhaps a fine
    dust from the roots produced a violent headache, much like that caused
    by the fumes of dynamite. I remembered that quarrymen find relief from
    dynamite-fume headaches by drinking strong, hot coffee, and similarly
    we found this beverage an effective remedy for our headaches.</p>

  <p>“Cleared of invading roots, the cavity was now really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span> a cavity.
    Descending hand over hand by the rope a full twelve feet from the
    level floor of the temple, I found myself standing on what seemed to
    be an accumulation of little stones and plaster, intermixed with small
    bones which I took to be those of animals that had been the prey of
    the <i lang="myn">chaib</i>. There was a good deal of parchment-like material lying
    about, which I thought at first was cast-off skin of the big boa, but
    which was actually an epidermal root-covering sifted down from above.
    Standing at the bottom of the square shaft and looking up at the
    vertical walls, I saw that each wall-surface was built up of a myriad
    of small cut blocks of tan-colored limestone, so smoothly polished as
    to suggest marble. It was unlike any ancient wall-surface I had ever
    seen. The stones were not inserted in mortar like Florentine wall
    mosaics; neither were they built up into high relief, like the famous
    walls of tombs and chambers at Mitla. Rather, each tier of small stones
    was cut to a bevel, with the upper or horizontal surface projecting
    some two inches beyond the face of the tier above.</p>

  <p>“As nearly as I can describe it, the effect was like the siding,
    or clapboards, on a house, supposing that the siding were put on
    upside down, thick side uppermost. The stones were cut with exceeding
    niceness, and each wall section, though simple, combined with the
    others to form a most artistic whole. At the four corners, where the
    lateral bands would have met, they were intercepted by vertical stone
    bands about four inches wide, running from bottom to top of the shaft.</p>

  <p>“At the time I could spare only a passing interest in these walls,
    for in the debris beneath my feet were fragments of pottery and
    a projecting human jaw-bone. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> painstakingly removed the stone
    fragments and mortar-dust. Working with trowel, spatula, and
    whisk-broom, I found that the chamber contained the disordered remains
    of two graves.</p>

  <p>“Evidently one grave had originally been superimposed on the other,
    and the contents of the two had been thrown together by the force of
    falling debris from above. The two graves, I think, were once square
    and separated by stone slabs. Here I found fragments of pottery and
    splintered human bones, brittle with age and gnawed by rodents.
    Reconstructing the scene from the fragments, I surmise that each grave
    contained, besides its human remains, a small, shallow tripod vessel,
    the outer surface of which was burnished with red pigment, and a deeper
    gourd-like vessel. I believe that the shallow dish contained food and
    that the deeper one was filled with drink of some sort—very likely
    <i lang="myn">sacca</i> or <i lang="myn">bal-che</i>, both of which the ancient Mayas believed were
    acceptable to the soul of the departed and to the gods.</p>

  <p>“The skeletons were so broken and disturbed that beyond the fact that
    they were two in number and that the bones were so old they were
    fragile as pipe-stems, nothing else was casually to be noticed. The
    finding of skeletal remains and of funerary urns made it clear beyond
    dispute that this building was a mausoleum, a tomb of kings or of
    priests.</p>

  <p>“I carefully collected all of this fragmentary material and sent it
    aloft to be preserved for future study. Then I made measurements of the
    chamber and jotted them down in my note-book. This being done, I turned
    my attention to the stone floor of the tomb. My steel stethoscope
    indicated that below there was a still deeper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span> cavity. With much
    careful effort we pried up the stone floor-slabs, disclosing another
    grave. Apparently this burial-vault had suffered but slightly from
    the concussions and disturbances which had all but destroyed the two
    upper graves. The walls and bottom were lined with thin slabs of stone
    covered with mortar. Much of the mortar had flecked off and lay spread
    out unevenly over the various objects in the grave, but no serious
    harm had been done either to the skeletal remains or to the funerary
    vessels. The bones, however, had been gnawed and dragged out of place
    by rodents.</p>

  <p>“A shallow earthen vessel was found in the grave, of the customary
    small tripod type, painted red, with a blue line around the rim. A
    bowl-shaped vessel, gray-colored and smooth, was placed at the right
    of the skeleton, and both vessels were half filled with sifted mortar.
    Even though the bones were somewhat disarranged, it was plain that the
    human remains had been buried with the knees drawn up to the chin, and
    the arms placed over them, with hands clasped. I found the hunched-up
    remains reclining upon their right side. Whether the body had been so
    buried or had been buried in a sitting position and had later toppled
    over, is a matter for conjecture. If this grave or the others had ever
    held anything of perishable nature it had completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>“When the vault had been cleared, I resorted once more to my crude
    stethoscope, which left no doubt of a still further cavity. Raising the
    floor-slabs, we discovered a grave similar to grave Number Three, but
    the contents were interesting variations. The usual tripod vessel was
    there and also the bowl-shaped container, but the bottom inner surface
    of the tripodal receptacle was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span> cross-hatched with deep-cut lines,
    and beside it was a large tripod vessel containing a caking of hard
    material that proved to be copal incense of finest quality. It was so
    altered by time that it was crystallized, almost fossilized, but when a
    small portion was burned it gave off the familiar copal fragrance.</p>

  <p>“In one corner of the vault, almost hidden under mortar-dust, was a
    little heap of verdigris. This proved to be a number of copper bells,
    like our sleigh-bells in shape but very much smaller, like the bells
    brought up from the Sacred Well. The outer bells in the heap were so
    oxidized that they simply flaked away when we tried to clean them,
    but the inner ones retained their shape and finish even after they
    were washed and cleaned. Copper bells played an important part in the
    rituals and in the economic life of the ancient Mayas and of their
    successors, even down to almost modern times. That old and faithful
    chronicler Padre Cogolludo says of the olden people: ‘The monies they
    used were copper bells and valuable according to their size.’ But the
    probable reason for the presence of bells in this tomb is the fact that
    in still older history bells were a part of the regalia of Ah Puch,
    the God of Death, and were attached as anklets to his person. He is so
    shown in the many hieroglyphs of him.</p>

  <p>“The skeletal remains in this grave seemed to point to a re-burial.
    Either the bones were taken from another tomb and re-interred here or
    else they were cleared of their integuments and flesh prior to burial.
    I say this because they were found in a queer bundle-like heap, with no
    reference to their relative anatomical positions.</p>

  <p>“In all of these graves were found traces of wood-ashes, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>but no signs
    of burned or calcined bones to bear out any theory of cremation.</p>

  <p>“Once again the steel stethoscope was put to use and again it told us
    that we had not struck bottom. The floor of the fourth opened up into a
    fifth grave, deeper than any of the preceding ones and more free from
    accumulations. It contained pottery and a mingled heap of bones, as
    the grave above had done. But in one corner, just where we had found
    copper bells in the grave above, we discovered what looked like a dusty
    pile of glass, which proved to be a handful of beautifully polished and
    glistening rock-crystal beads some of which were handsomely fluted.
    This find was the first recorded one of rock-crystal beads or pendants
    in Yucatan. And amid the dust and debris on the floor we recovered a
    dozen or more perfectly cut and artfully shaped jade beads of small
    size. They were found either just above the surface or buried in a
    fine ash deposit which may have destroyed somewhat their original
    luster. Even so, they are valuable specimens, especially because of the
    surroundings.</p>

  <p>“The floor of this fifth and last of the several graves was on a
    level with the base of the pyramid, and I concluded, therefore, that
    it rested upon ledge-rock formation and that we had now reached the
    end of our search. In fact, I had noted an upward tilt in the ledge
    rock and had wondered why we had not already encountered it in the
    shaft. The ancient builders very wisely took advantage of these rises
    and outcroppings of ledge rock, in placing their buildings, so as to
    save filling-material and the labor otherwise required to give the
    structures a solid foundation.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

  <p>“Judge of my surprise, despite my silent prediction, when the
    tuning-fork device again signaled, ‘Good-sized cavity below’! It took
    more than a casual glance to find the seams in the floor of the crypt,
    so closely were the stones fitted, and we had considerable difficulty
    in dislodging and raising them. Instead of a sixth and similar tomb we
    encountered a flight of steps hewn out of the living rock.</p>

  <p>“We had spent many days of constant back-breaking labor in the
    excavation of the five graves, the noting of data, the preparation of
    the specimens, and the packing of them in cases. Incidentally, the
    deeper we went, the greater was our danger of cracked skulls from
    falling stones and we had all taken to wearing stiff, high-crowned,
    wide-brimmed Mexican sombreros. The high crowns we stuffed with
    <i lang="myn">pochote</i> (tree-cotton). We covered our shoulders with thick pads of
    gunny-sack, worn like a cape. When not working we threw the flaps back
    over our shoulders. Occasionally a stone did fall, striking harmlessly
    upon our improvised helmets and padded shoulders. If, however, it
    chanced to hit a naked leg there was a howl of mingled pain and rage,
    followed by words of unmingled Maya expletive. Such accidents happened
    but rarely and the whole undertaking went through without a single
    serious mishap.</p>

  <p>“Each day, as the work progressed and we went farther and farther down,
    the light from above became more and more feeble, except when the sun
    was at the zenith, and much of our work had to be done by candlelight.
    When we came to the flight of steps we found it so choked with ashes,
    lime-dust, small bits of stone, potsherds, and charcoal, each in
    quantity in the order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> indicated, that at first we could obtain no
    idea of the dimensions of the chamber below. From the contour of the
    roof-stones I judged it was not large, but it was so filled with debris
    that I had to enter it feet foremost and lie upon my side to fill the
    wicker baskets with material and pass them back to one of my helpers,
    who in turn passed them on. Thus from one to another they passed,
    until they could be hoisted up to daylight, where trusted hands and
    experienced eyes separated the dross and placed the remainder in field
    safety-boxes for my later inspection.</p>

  <p>“In this manner, an endless chain of filled baskets went up and empty
    ones came down to one man in the mysterious vault, lying on his back,
    half naked, dripping with sweat, and plastered with grime, but now and
    then smiling seraphically as he caught the gleam of a shining jade
    jewel or a finely worked bit of flint. He could not see clearly for
    more than an instant at a time, for when he was not blinded by sweat
    the alkaline ash-dust smote his eyes, and the two at times combined to
    make him fairly writhe. And he would not have changed places with a
    king, for every once in a while he came upon something more precious to
    him than kingly possessions.</p>

  <p>“At first this work progressed very slowly for, perforce, I was the
    only worker in the heaped-up chamber, my head and shoulders in the
    flickering light of wild wax-candles while the rest of my body was
    buried in the darkness of unknown centuries, my high-booted feet
    crowding against who knows what noxious cave creatures.</p>

  <p>“The mass of material, though hard-packed by time, was mostly
    wood-ashes; and once these were loosened, a heavy booted foot or even a
    sandaled one might injure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> some priceless museum specimen. And so for
    a while I preferred to work alone in the confined space. At last I had
    cleared away the accumulation above the second step of the stairway,
    and I worked a clear space about the third step, using only my bare
    hands, a sculptor’s spatula, and a whisk-broom. Even the trowel was
    tabooed. Finally a sufficient space was cleared for my two most trusted
    aides, Manuel and Pedro, to work beside me and then the work progressed
    more rapidly.</p>

  <p>“For several days things went along in this manner, with our interest
    and curiosity mounting hourly, so that all who worked with me, down to
    the last peon, grew feverishly excited and food and drink became mere
    irritating interruptions. And each day added to our hoard of potsherds,
    human bones, and shining jade.</p>

  <p>“To this day I cannot think of that strange chamber without wonder.
    Neither can I account for the presence of the material which so nearly
    filled it. That it was a depository for the contents of previous
    burial-places, is, I think, a fact beyond a doubt. Ashes, half-burned
    fragments, even pieces of smooth wall-finish foreign to this particular
    chamber, potsherds and jade ornaments—all lead to this conclusion. At
    first I thought that the place had been a crematory, but I was soon
    convinced that this could not have been so.</p>

  <p>“As the work went forward the outline of the chamber became well
    defined. The opening was relatively high and wide and I could stand
    there almost erect. The passage, however, narrowed quickly like a
    funnel, ending in a dead wall. The week was drawing to a close and with
    it, so it appeared, our task. The work within that deep-down, badly
    ventilated shaft was not too pleasant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> The air was close; the place
    was frightfully hot, and the big wax candles, dim and smoky, did not
    tend to make the place more comfortable.</p>

  <p>“We three—Manuel, Pedro, and I—were stripped to the waist and looked
    more like chimney-sweeps than delvers after scientific lore. The work
    seemed so nearly at an end that we kept doggedly on, the boys digging
    and sifting while I stopped frequently to make notes. Late in the day,
    all seemed finished except for a few isolated ash-heaps and a big flat
    stone that leaned again the very end of the wall.</p>

  <p>“Heaving a sigh of relief and wiping away the layer of grime and sweat
    from my eyes, I said, ‘Well, boys, there’s nothing left but to haul
    away that big flat stone and sweep up the ashes behind it on the chance
    that there are some beads or small objects in the mess; then we’ll take
    a few measurements and call the job finished.’ I grasped the stone
    slab with both hands and pulled it toward me. It yielded so suddenly
    that I fell back with it; and my companions likewise fell back, for,
    instead of uncovering a pile of ashes, it disclosed a big, circular,
    pitch-black hole and from that unsuspected, terrible hole came a long,
    soughing rush of cold, damp wind. Our candles went out at once, leaving
    us in inky blackness. The cold wind chilled our overheated bodies.
    I was left with an insecure foothold too near the opening to dare a
    movement in the dark. The two natives were simply glued to their places
    in sheer terror.</p>

  <p>“Finally Pedro spoke. ‘It is the mouth of hell,’ he said, and I heard
    his teeth chatter as he said it. Even then, with my feet so placed on
    the sloping wall-space and my body so inclined on the sloping floor
    that it seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span> as if an incautious move might slide me smoothly into
    that black hole and through it into Eternity, I felt a pleased interest
    in Pedro’s statement, for to the ancient Mayas, hell, called by them
    Metnal, was not a burning pit of fire and brimstone but a dank, cold
    place where lost souls, benumbed with chill, struggled forever in
    thick, dark mud. The words of Pedro, coming so spontaneously from the
    heart and coinciding so nearly with the ancient belief, the belief of
    his ancestors, caused me to wonder.</p>

  <p>“For the moment, however, it suited my purpose to have the more
    Christian idea prevail and I did some rapid missionary work, saying
    reprovingly in the native tongue, ‘<i lang="myn">Ehen</i>, Pedro! What did Padre Ortiz
    say about the hot flames of an ever-burning hell? It is a cold wind and
    not a hot flame that comes from this hole.’ My logic evidently appealed
    to them and freed them of a superstitious fear and they became once
    more calm and resourceful.</p>

  <p>“Working slowly and carefully in the utter darkness, we managed to
    block up the hole with our wide-brimmed hats and we held them in place
    by toppling the big flat stone against them. I was then able to get to
    my feet and relight our candles. By long experience in subterranean
    work, cave explorations, and descents into ancient cisterns, I have
    learned to take certain basic precautions. As one of these, I wear
    about my neck, hanging from a stout cord of deerskin, an air-tight
    metal case within which are a glass vial of proof alcohol and some
    wax matches. By this means I am freed of the vexation of damp matches
    and a futile blue line of phosphorescence when a light is quickly and
    urgently needed. I also carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span> invariably in such work a small Davy
    lamp and a hundred-foot steel tape.</p>

  <p>“The lamp is a safeguard against possible gas explosions. Lighting
    it, I once more uncovered the hole, and once more the rush of cold
    air began. I waited until the air-currents had balanced themselves
    as nearly as they were likely to do and then proceeded to a further
    examination of the hole. The orifice was about thirty inches in
    diameter and after piercing the rock for about two feet it opened into
    a cavity of unknown size and depth. I could, of course, have dropped a
    stone into the cavity and timed its fall, gaining at least some idea
    of the depth. But I wanted to take no chance of breaking anything
    of antiquarian interest which might be there. Instead, I fastened
    the lantern to the end of the steel tape and slowly lowered it into
    the hole, but the thickness of the two-foot wall between me and the
    perpendicular descent prevented me from seeing what was discovered by
    the lantern as it went down. So I had the two boys hold tight to my
    legs while I squirmed through the orifice until, head down, I could
    sway freely above the pit. The convulsive hold on my legs assured me
    that I should not drop down the hole suddenly if the boys could prevent
    it, so I turned my entire attention to the void beneath me.</p>

  <p>“By feeling the tape nicks as the lantern rested on the bottom of
    the pit I found the depth was almost exactly fifty feet. By swinging
    my body and the tape with the lantern at the end like a pendulum I
    ascertained that the cavity was bottle-shaped and about twenty feet
    wide at the bottom. I also ascertained that it was quite dry, the air
    pure in it and the ventilation perfect. This seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> to be all of the
    data necessary for the moment, so I had the boys pull me back to terra
    firma and then cautioned them to say nothing whatever about our latest
    discovery. And so we returned to the upper air and the scent of orchids
    and to a hearty supper.</p>

  <p>“That night, when I knew the men were resting and chatting before
    taking to their guitars and their hammocks, I sent for Manuel—wise,
    level-headed, dependable, my trusted companion through long years of
    this sort of work. I said to him, ‘Manuel, to-morrow is going to be a
    very interesting day even for old-timers like you and me and we shall
    not often see and handle that which I hope we shall discover to-morrow.
    Now, I want you to see Juan Cancio, Mathildé Uh, and José Uh. I will
    see Pedro and his brother. Tell Juan, Mathildé, and José to meet us
    here at five o’clock in the morning with their machetes, with their
    water-gourds filled and with dinner in the <i lang="myn">sabucan</i>. And, Manuel, tell
    each of them that a shut mouth catches no flies. We may find something
    and we may find nothing but piled earth, and if the latter we do not
    want the other men laughing at us behind our backs.’</p>

  <p>“Early the next morning we hastened toward the mound and with us went
    stout ropes, block and tackle, shovels, and all the necessary tools
    for six men. We slid down the rope into the shaft and then made our
    way down the stairway into the funnel-shaped chamber. Here we fixed
    a strong post and attached to it a double block and tackle, with the
    several necessary ropes, so that all of us could safely descend and
    ascend the fifty-foot bottle beyond the small, dark orifice. With a
    lighted miner’s lamp on my head and my Davy lamp preceding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> me by ten
    feet, I placed my foot in a noose in one of the ropes, swung myself
    through the orifice, and hung over the pit. Between my teeth was my
    sharp hunting knife which I always carry in this fashion in entering a
    subterranean reservoir.</p>

  <p>“My plans were well made and it was my intention to be lowered slowly
    that I might study these grim walls as I descended. I had gone down
    less than half the distance when I began to turn and whirl in the air
    like a dancing dervish, with the difference that the dervish whirls on
    solid ground, to the prayerful cries of his brethren, and he can stop
    when he wishes, while I whirled in mid-air in darkness and silence,
    like some dead celestial sphere and as powerless to stop. In our haste
    we had forgotten to take the kinks out of the new ropes we were using
    and my rope was avenging itself by beginning to unkink as my weight was
    felt on its twisted strands. For a few seconds I could do nothing but
    hang on dizzily. Meanwhile the rapidly twisting rope had caught and
    jammed in the block, serving as a brake and had entirely checked my
    downward progress.</p>

  <p>“Suddenly a coil of rope from above fell loosely on my shoulders and
    aroused me to my danger. The men above, not knowing what was going
    on below in the darkness, were steadily paying out the rope and if
    the choked block became suddenly free, there was nothing to prevent
    my falling headlong through that terrible blackness to whatever was
    below. Hurriedly looping the rope as best I could, to insure my present
    safety, I yelled to the men above, and a voice came down to me,
    sounding thick and flat in that black space.</p>

  <p>“‘What is it, Master?’ the voice said.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

  <p>“‘Listen,’ I replied, as steadily as I could. ‘Do exactly as I tell
    you, for my life is at stake!’</p>

  <p>“‘We will do it, Master,’ answered the voice.</p>

  <p>“‘Haul up the slack of the rope until I tell you to stop.’</p>

  <p>“‘I hear you, Master,’ and the snake-like coils began to recede, to
    grow small, and finally to disappear. The slack had been taken up.
    ‘What now, Master?’ came the voice and I knew from the tension in it
    that the sight of the slack rope had told its own story.</p>

  <p>“‘Send me down Manuel and José.’ (They were the lightest and most agile
    of the men.) I had no more than spoken before they came sliding down
    the other ropes and shortly I was descending as slowly and carefully as
    I had planned to do, until the pilot light of the lamp touched ground
    beneath me, standing as firmly erect as though placed by unseen hands.
    I glanced at the two men beside me on the ropes and we all nodded our
    heads approvingly.</p>

  <p>“Below, clearly seen in the light of the lamp, was a pure-white vessel
    which had fallen apart, and from it streamed gleaming, shining objects.
    We landed as carefully as though stepping on a mound of eggs. Before
    taking our feet from the nooses we called to the men above to make
    the ropes fast and to be ready for our signals. Leaving the lantern
    standing as it was and no longer troubled by air-currents, we lit
    our candles. Directly in the center of the pit was a large mound and
    crowning it was the white vase, made of translucent material like
    alabaster, carved from a solid block and engraved with a leaf design
    in highly conventionalized meanders, combined with geometrical designs
    around the rim and sides. It was broken into several pieces, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span> these
    were large and the whole was quickly and easily fitted together into
    the original shape.</p>

  <p>“The vase, which had a capacity of about a quart, contained a quantity
    of exquisite jade beads and pendants, a large plaque with surfaces
    richly carved and representing conventionalized human figures with
    religious regalia, a polished jade globe over an inch in diameter
    and shining clear in spite of the ages of dust, oblong pendants, and
    thin, minutely carved ear-ornaments. This was but a tenth of what the
    vessel had once held. The rest we found later in the heaped-up material
    beneath it.</p>

  <p>“At a signal anxiously expected, the other men came swirling down
    the ropes like firemen sliding down a brass pole to answer an alarm.
    Then we all went to work. Each of the men had had long experience in
    similar labors under my supervision. Occasionally was heard a swift
    intake of breath and a man would hold up some interesting find and then
    settle back to his task. While they worked I made notes, numbered the
    specimens, and helped to pack them in the safety-boxes. Thus the work
    went on. Occasionally we had to stop to kill a <i lang="myn">tzeentum</i>, a big, flat,
    crab-like spider. <i lang="myn">Tzeentum</i> spiders can give an ugly sting producing
    a fever hard to subdue, and at times they seem to swarm out of hidden
    crevices. By reason of their flat bodies and quick movements, killing
    them is not always easy.</p>

  <p>“We found temple vases, incense-burners, tripod vessels, cylindrical
    urns, some of which are perfect, others marred, and many broken. We
    obtained fragments of large, hard-baked earthen vessels of complicated
    design. Unbroken, these must have been at least thirty-six inches
    high. We secured, also, chipped flints of fine workmanship <span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>and of
    unknown use. All these and many other finds came to us from this mound,
    and after it had been gone over carefully by hand and had then been
    screened we decided we had left nothing of value and as with one mind
    we began to think of supper. Pedro swarmed up one of the ropes hand
    over hand, followed by his brother, and they hoisted the specimen cases
    and tools. The rest of the workers followed one by one. I was the last
    to leave the mysterious burial-chamber, which seemed to name itself by
    occult suggestion ‘The Sepulcher of the High Priest.’ And as I left
    its dark depths behind me, the mysterious atmosphere, which no one,
    probably, will ever be able to dissipate, seemed to cling to me.</p>

  <p>“When we arrived at the top of the square-walled shaft it was eleven
    o’clock at night and all the people of the plantation were there,
    anxiously awaiting us. The families of the men who accompanied me were
    in a hysterical state. Ropes had been brought and an attempt was about
    to be made at our rescue. With our specimen cases held aloft and in the
    midst of a rejoicing crowd we returned to the plantation house and soon
    the noise died away and we all slept.</p>

  <p>“I am asked why I call this shrine upon the mound with the crypt
    beneath it the Temple of the High Priest. That is a fair question.</p>

  <p>“I believe there comes to most sentient beings, after protracted
    periods of intense observation and deep interest in a given subject, a
    certain mental domination over the subject beyond a mere recognition
    of the facts which have been encountered. One becomes possessed of a
    clarity of vision not psychic but reaching farther than cold logic.
    Call it intuition or what not; it so frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> arrives at the right
    answer, spanning the gap that cannot be spanned by the chain of facts,
    that I have great respect for it when it is honest, genuine, and
    strongly felt.</p>

  <p>“As I left behind me the black depths of the pit, its haunting mystery
    seemed to permeate me. I had had the same strange feeling come over
    me before, in research work among the burial-places of Labna and also
    during and after my discovery of the ruined city of Xkickmook. Never
    had it been so potent, so definite as when I ascended this wonderful
    old burial-shaft and came into the moonlight of the living world.</p>

  <p>“The feeling, impressive beyond words, was undoubtedly intensified by
    the vision of the treasures I had so recently seen and handled: the
    beautiful alabaster-like vase above all comparison with anything of its
    kind hitherto found in the whole Maya area; the remarkable terra-cotta
    votive urns nearly three feet high, each bearing the mask of a god
    surrounded with sacred ornaments; the elaborate incense-burners and
    other extraordinary pottery; the big, polished, globular beads of
    jade; the carved jade plaque; the labrets, ear- and nose-ornaments;
    the tubular rosettes; the thin disks of polished jade; the wonderfully
    worked, flawless ornaments of flint, shaped like the parts of the
    crozier of a bishop.</p>

  <p>“And linked with these in my mind’s eye were the deeply paneled
    surfaces of walls and columns, everywhere in the Sacred City, depicting
    god-like personages with all the regalia of exalted priesthood:
    neck-chains of big globular beads, breast-plaques of finely carved
    design, ear- and nose-ornaments, and, grasped in the hand of these
    dignitaries, a staff crowned with an object resembling the crozier of a
    bishop.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

  <p>“To me these pictures and the finds we had just made dovetailed
    perfectly. Beyond dispute, too, is that fact that many ancient races
    placed at the side of the departed those things which were most used
    in life and which they would, presumably, want first in the hereafter.
    The old Phœnicians, the Egyptians, the Scythians, the Norsemen, the
    Eskimos, the redskins of the North and West, the Pueblos and the
    Nahuatls, and the Incas and pre-Incas—all followed this custom. And I
    know at first hand that the Mayas were no exception, for I have found
    well-defined graves, never previously disturbed—graves containing
    child skeletons with toys beside them; graves of women in which were
    bone needles and spinning-whorls of terra-cotta or worked stone; graves
    where beside the thick bones of once-powerful men were found flint
    lance-heads and heads of darts for the <i lang="myn">hul-che</i> and knife-points of
    obsidian.</p>

  <p>“Beyond question I had uncovered the last resting-place of a priest
    obviously of very high rank. Reason and logic and facts carry us thus
    far. But those five hidden graves, each guarding the one below and
    blocking the way to the deep secret passage and the pit at its end
    wherein lay the sacred relics of the arch-priest—how may these be
    explained? It is here that the mysterious assurance came to me—the
    sure intuition, if you will—that this was not merely the tomb of a
    great priest but the tomb of <em>the</em> great priest, the tomb of the great
    leader, the tomb of the hero-god, Kukul Can, he whose symbol was the
    Feathered Serpent. Evidence is lacking, I can offer no scientific
    proof, and yet I am certain that ultimately further discoveries in the
    Sacred City will bear out my intuitive belief.”</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
      <span class="small">THE LEGEND OF THE SACRIFICIAL PILGRIMAGE</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WITHIN the province of Mani the water-holes, the <i lang="myn">satenejas</i>, were dry.
    For many weeks no rain had fallen and the growing corn had withered and
    died. The people were perishing of hunger and thirst and Ah Pula Xia,
    overlord of the province, saw that something must be done and swiftly
    or the tribe of Mani would be no more.</p>

  <p>And so he caused the great summons to be sounded, the command to every
    man, women, and child in the whole province to appear before him—the
    command that had not been heard for twenty years. The <i lang="myn">uliche</i>,
    drumsticks with heads of rubber, striking upon the <i lang="myn">tunkul</i>, caused
    the earth to tremble with the loud booming of the summons, while
    swift-footed <i lang="myn">holpopes</i>, or runners, carried the message to the most
    distant parts of the nation.</p>

  <p>At the appointed time Ah Pula ascended to his kingly seat under the
    spreading shade of the great <i lang="myn">yax-che</i>, the sacred tree of the Mayas,
    and grouped around him were his councilors and chiefs; the <i lang="myn">ah-kin</i>,
    the high priest, the <i lang="myn">kulel</i>, the aged prime minister, the <i lang="myn">nacon</i>,
    chief of the warriors. Behind each of their leaders were grouped the
    officers of lesser grades, each clad in his richest vestments and
    holding the badge of his office. And flanking these nobles were the
    <i lang="myn">tupiles</i>, or guardians of the law,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> in long lines; and each bore the
    white wand, insignia of their authority. Beyond, as far as the eye
    could see, clear to the horizon where the level plain met the forest,
    were massed the commoners, the whole nation of Mani.</p>

  <p>Slowly Ah Pula, the <i lang="myn">batab</i>, rose from his throne, and as he rose
    the tall lances, the great battle-swords, and the <i lang="myn">hul-ches</i> clashed
    together in one mighty salutation like the sound of giant trees
    crashing to earth in a hurricane.</p>

  <p>The gaze of the <i lang="myn">batab</i> roved over the assembled multitude and with one
    hand upraised he commanded silence.</p>

  <p>“O friends and councilors, sons and brothers! Those armed for war and
    ever ready to defend the province! Priests of the Sun, who bring to
    us the words of our gods and transmit to them our prayers! Listen to
    my words and listen closely, that your answering thoughts may be well
    chosen and weighty, light-bringing and life-giving. Thus and thus only
    may we survive the calamity that threatens.</p>

  <p>“Five times have the seasons come and gone. Five times have we planted
    our fields of corn since the strange white men came to our land. We
    did not invite them nor seek them. They sought us, these strange white
    men coming in strange craft from a far land. They came and we did not
    welcome them as did the Cheles and the Peches, nor did we meet them as
    enemies when the Cupules, the Cochuahes, and the Cocomes fought against
    them. Three times while they were here we planted and gathered abundant
    harvests. Three times have we planted our fields since their departure.
    Twice we have failed to gather enough even for seed for the following
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>season and the last planting, the third one, is now parched and dying.</p>

  <p>“How, then, shall we feed our people? How shall we fill the breasts of
    the nursing mothers and warm the cooling blood of the aged and feeble?
    In this time of need even the wisest and strongest require the wisdom
    and counsel of their brothers.”</p>

  <p>Ah Pula Xia the king sat once more upon his throne, that ancient seat
    of authority shaped in the form of a jaguar. Turning, he said to the
    <i lang="myn">ah-kin</i>, the high priest, in measured words, “O Father of the Temple,
    Brother of the Sun, tell us from the store of thy sacred knowledge and
    from thy god-given wisdom, why have the gods been deaf to our prayers?
    What have we done that they have forsaken us and left us to be scourged
    so sorely?”</p>

  <p>The pontiff, tall, spare, and lined of feature, with eyes burning
    bright in their deep sockets, rose from his seat and faced the king.
    His words came forth so clear and simply that even the youngest and the
    dullest of his hearers could not fail to hear and, hearing, understand:</p>

  <p>“O Batab, ruler! O Halach Uinic, father of thy people, hear what the
    outraged gods say through my lips to thee and thy people:</p>

  <p>“‘Unknown beings from a strange land and worshiping pagan gods have
    polluted this earth with their tread, have deafened our ears with their
    foreign tongue and defiled our temples with prayers to other gods.
    They have entered as guests into your towns and villages and you have
    received them. They have lived in your homes and you have suffered it.
    Your servants, at your command, have given them food and drink.</p>

  <p>“‘The gods of our fathers are slow to wrath. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span> waited in patience
    your repentance, but you repented not. Then did the gods turn against
    you their wrath. With quarrels and dissensions they divided the evil
    white men. With pestilence and strange diseases they decimated them.
    Smitten by enemies, harassed by insects, and poisoned by reptiles,
    these white men faded in strength and numbers, until the few that still
    lived returned to the unknown land whence they came.</p>

  <p>“‘All this was by the command of your gods, the gods that now you have
    forgotten. But though the serpent passes, his trail still remains.
    Because of these things that you have done the gods are punishing you.
    They have forbidden the clouds to form and they have forbidden the
    rain to fall. They have forbidden the grain to germinate and the roots
    to sprout in forest or field. They have caused hosts of insects to
    devastate your stores and eat up your substance. They have brought upon
    you terrible diseases that your wise men and physicians cannot cure.’</p>

  <p>“You ask what can be done to appease the anger of the gods. Now, the
    knowledge has come to me, through the ancient records and writings
    handed down from high priest to high priest since time began, that once
    before in the history of our people was the wrath of the gods, and
    especially the wrath of Yum Chac, the Rain God, kindled against us when
    we forgot his precepts and disobeyed his teachings.</p>

  <p>“In that olden time beautiful maidens were sent to him as messengers,
    to plead for his forgiveness and to carry with them rich offerings of
    viands, flowers, and precious jewels. Thus was his ire appeased and
    fecundity restored to this unhappy land.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

  <p>“My words are these: ‘Let us follow the ancient example. Let us go in
    solemn procession with maidens as chaste and lovely as the opening
    buds of the white pitahaya, to carry our plea to the god, and with our
    prayers let us send food and drink in fine vessels, the ripest fruit,
    the fattest grain, and our richest jewels. Thus may we hope to avert
    the divine wrath and restore to life our starving nation.’”</p>

  <p>The <i lang="myn">kulel</i>, the prime minister, then stepped forward. His form was
    bent, his hair gray, and his face seamed with lines of deep thought.
    His voice, though low and calm, was heard distinctly amid the crowding
    ranks of the common people.</p>

  <p>Said he, “O Batab, ruler of the people, we have listened to the words
    of our pontiff and his words befit his high office. We listen to them
    with the respect due him as high priest and as the mouthpiece of the
    gods. To hear these words and the command they convey, is to obey
    without question.</p>

  <p>“He who is ordered by those above to go upon a journey, surely goes
    if he is faithful. But he who goes upon such a journey without
    due preparation is not a good servant, for, by reason of his
    unpreparedness, he may be delayed, led astray, or otherwise impeded in
    carrying out the will of his master.</p>

  <p>“Therefore let us think what this act of expiation requires us to do,
    and then consider how to do it with the least delay and without waste
    of life and effort. What we seek to gain is evident, for we all feel
    the pangs of hunger and have seen our nearest and dearest fade away
    and die. We have seen the grain and the fruit wither. We have seen our
    scant stores devoured by clouds of insects.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> We have seen our people
    wander into the deep forest seeking food and they have never returned.</p>

  <p>“What we most desire is to appease the dread anger of our gods, that we
    may have once again food and health and happiness.</p>

  <p>“We are all agreed that we must make sacrifice at the Sacred Well,
    the Chen Ku of Chi-chen Itza. The question is, then, how shall we
    reach the Sacred Well and how shall we make our sacrifice? The way is
    long, full of thorns, and covered with sharp stones. The thorns are
    the lance-points and the stones the pointed darts of the Cocomes, the
    Cochuahes, and the Cupules, our ancient enemies, through whom we must
    pass to reach the well. Either we must gain their permission to pass in
    peace and friendship or we must push our way through them by force of
    arms.</p>

  <p>“My voice is for peace with these our lifelong enemies. I have said.”</p>

  <p>Then came the <i lang="myn">nacon</i>, the chief of all the fighting men, powerful,
    thick-set and sturdy. As he arose the warriors clashed their weapons in
    a deafening roar and then all were silent, awaiting his words.</p>

  <p>“O Batab, ruler,” he said, “we have listened with reverence to the
    words of our high priest, with awe and submission to the words of our
    gods that came from his lips. We have heard with respect the measured,
    temperate wisdom of our aged <i lang="myn">kulel</i>. He has said that we must not
    delay our sacrifice and yet his voice is for peace.</p>

  <p>“I, too, say that we must not delay, but why need we who are among
    the greatest and strongest in the land, ask of any one permission to
    sacrifice and worship? Who gave the Cocomes the right to say who may
    worship in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span> the temples or make sacrifice at the Sacred Well? Is not
    Chi-chen Itza the holy city of the gods, our gods as well as theirs?</p>

  <p>“Let us open wide the path to and from the Sacred City and keep it open
    with the points of our spears, the keen edges of our swords, and the
    swift terror of our <i lang="myn">hul-ches</i>. I have spoken.”</p>

  <p>The <i lang="myn">batab</i>, with the <i lang="myn">ah-kin</i>, the <i lang="myn">kulel</i>, and the <i lang="myn">nacon</i> turned
    toward the assembled people and the <i lang="myn">batab</i> cried in tones that rolled
    over the thickly packed mass and beyond into the trees of the forest:</p>

  <p>“What is your voice? What is the word of my people?”</p>

  <p>With a noise like thunder came the mighty chorus:</p>

  <p>“We want food! We are dying. We go into the forest to dig for roots to
    fill our empty stomachs and we find none. The land is accursed and even
    the birds no longer fly over it and the snakes even no longer burrow
    within it.”</p>

  <p>The <i lang="myn">batab</i> pondered deeply and long, then raised his head and said:</p>

  <p>“This we will do: We will first ask of the Cocomes that they allow our
    people to pass to make sacrifice at the Sacred Well. If they consent we
    will make a great pilgrimage and a sacrifice that shall be remembered
    through the ages to come, for it will be the seal of friendship and
    of peace between old and bitter enemies. If they refuse us their
    permission to pass freely and to make our sacrifice, we will then take
    that right, as they of old took it, by force, and by force we will hold
    it for all time.</p>

  <p>“Now, this very night we will send the message to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> the Cocomes, so that
    we may know without delay what course to follow. Until then let each of
    you in his own way so prepare that whatever comes we shall be ready.</p>

  <p>“At once, summon the swiftest runners to take the message to Nachi
    Cocom, Batab of Zotuta, and through him to his allies, the Cupules and
    the Cochuahes!”</p>

  <p>Nachi Cocom, Batab of Zotuta, King of the Cocomes and leader of allied
    provinces, sat in his great council chamber. About him were his chiefs
    and nobles and those of his allies, the Cupules and the Cochuahes. Upon
    the high walls of the council chamber were war-banners and trophies of
    many hard-won battles. On broad wooden platforms, one at each end of
    the building, were heaped the captured weapons, war-masks, and armor of
    those who had fought against the Cocomes or their allies and lost.</p>

  <p>Gathered around the entrance were keen-eyed warriors armed with
    lances and swords and <i lang="myn">hul-ches</i>. Lounging but watchful, they first
    gave the warning, high-pitched and long, that echoed through the city
    and carried even to the houses nestled in the fringe of the forest:
    “<i lang="myn">Hek-utal le macoboo!</i> Here come strangers!” Down the winding path
    came the messengers from the Batab of Mani, carrying his word to Nachi
    Cocom, Batab of Zotuta.</p>

  <p>The messengers were three brothers, picked men, <i lang="myn">holpopes</i> all three;
    good men to look upon and worthy of their office. For Mayas they were
    tall but well proportioned and lithe, as supple as young jaguars.
    Wide of brow and clear-eyed they were. None could doubt their fitness
    to be the messengers of the king. Striding up to where the Batab of
    Zotuta and those of his council<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span> sat, each fearlessly and proudly made
    his obeisance and gave his salute—the sign of a <i lang="myn">holpope</i> bringing a
    message. To the chief <i lang="myn">holpope</i>, the eldest and tallest of the three
    brothers, the <i lang="myn">batab</i> said, “Welcome, <i lang="myn">holpope</i>, and those with you.
    Speak!”</p>

  <p>Said the chief <i lang="myn">holpope</i>:</p>

  <p>“To thee, O Batab of Zotuta, I bring a message from the Batab of Mani
    and thus runs the message:</p>

  <p>“‘To the Batab of Zotuta and its provinces I, Batab of Mani and its
    provinces, send greeting.</p>

  <p>“‘We are brothers, in that we were both born and are nourished from the
    same earth-mother, this land of Mayab. Therefore I, Ah Pula Xia, Batab
    of Mani, do now and by these my chosen messengers send to you, Nachi
    Cocom, Batab of Zotuta, this brotherly greeting and with it a brother’s
    request:</p>

  <p>“‘The gods have smitten us sorely for our sins, you and me and all our
    people. I, Batab of Mani, with my people desire to make peace with our
    god by a pilgrimage of atonement and solemn rites of sacrifice, that we
    may once more receive the blessing of the Rain God, your god and ours.</p>

  <p>“‘We have had our brothers’ quarrels, but the quarrels of brothers can
    be forgotten. We have had our hard-fought battles, but wars that have
    been fought are things of the past, things to forget. To-day we are
    scourged together, you and I and all our people. Let us, then, forget
    the past with its bitter memories and come together like brothers,
    forgiving and forgiven. Let us unite in a great and solemn pilgrimage
    of atonement and sacrifice to the angered god, in his temple at the
    Sacred Well of Chi-chen Itza. Thus will his wrath be appeased.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span> The
    rains will follow the clouds in the heavens and fecundity will come
    once more to the earth, now sterile, baked, and dead.</p>

  <p>“‘For this we ask your word and your promise that my people may pass
    undisturbed and unharmed to pray in the temples and to make sacrifice
    to the Rain God in the Sacred Well at Chi-chen Itza. I and my people
    await your answer.’”</p>

  <p>Nachi Cocom sat motionless in thought, neither asking nor receiving
    counsel from those about him; and such was their fear and awe of this
    indomitable and cruel ruler that none dared speak as he sat with crafty
    eyes staring at the ground before him. At last he raised his head and
    fixed the messengers with his inscrutable gaze and said:</p>

  <p>“Messengers from the Batab of Mani, listen closely and carefully that
    your words to him be my words to you.</p>

  <p>“‘From the Batab of Zotuta to the Batab of Mani, greetings! You say
    that we are brothers, in that this land of Mayab is our common mother.
    You say that we are together and alike scourged by an outraged god.
    These things are true. The land, our common mother, has felt the curse
    of the white man’s tread. By this act was she violated and we, her
    sons, permitted it—you by acquiescence, I by impotence.</p>

  <p>“‘But all this is past, you say, and we must now find means to avert
    the disaster which threatens to overwhelm us both—a calamity that can
    be avoided only by a pilgrimage and sacrifice to Noh-och Yum Chac at
    the Sacred Well of Chi-chen Itza.</p>

  <p>“‘<i lang="myn">Be wale!</i>—so let it be!</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

  <p>“‘You say that brothers quarrel and then forgive; that the war that is
    ended may be forgotten.’</p>

  <p>“Now,” and here he bent forward and spoke in deep earnestness, while
    about his thin lips wreathed a twisted smile that made those who knew
    him well recoil in terror, “tell my brother, Ah Pula, Batab of Mani, to
    send his pilgrims, the maiden messengers, the sacrificial offerings,
    and the priests, when and how he wishes. When they come they will
    find me and my people ready and waiting to give them warm welcome. No
    spear shall be cast, no weapon raised against them. We will guard the
    pilgrims and send them on their way to worship and to make sacrifice to
    that god with whom they so urgently wish to make peace—to your god and
    our god, for are we not the offspring of a common mother?</p>

  <p>“They will need to bring neither food nor arms, for I, Nachi Cocom,
    and my people will provide these things. Thus can your people come on
    more quickly to ask the forgiveness of the god for traitorous acts,
    snake-like deceptions, and cowardly submission to strange white men.</p>

  <p>“I have spoken. Messengers of Mani, eat, drink, rest, and then
    speed back the word of Nachi Cocom to—” and here again he smiled
    sardonically—“to his brother Ah Pula Xia.”</p>

  <p>Thereupon the <i lang="myn">batab</i> rose and departed, and his councilors likewise
    left the chamber.</p>

  <p>But the chief councilor spoke in a whisper to his brother, leader of
    the warriors, and said:</p>

  <p>“No man may know but the <i lang="myn">batab</i> himself what thoughts are deep buried
    in his mind, but I know and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span> fear that thin-lipped smile, and as he
    spoke to the messengers of Mani a strange feeling came over me like
    <i lang="myn">ek muyal</i>, the black cloud. I had a fear of something, intangible but
    terrible; something he is planning that will bring down upon us the
    annihilating wrath of the gods.”</p>

  <p>“Brother,” his companion answered, “do not voice such thoughts nor even
    think them. I have forgotten that you spoke. Remember that the will of
    the <i lang="myn">batab</i> is supreme. We may not question it. I also felt your fear,
    but say no more!”</p>

  <p>Swiftly, tirelessly the messengers of Mani sped on their homeward
    journey; over sunlit plains, threaded by the smooth worn paths of the
    jaguar and the wild boar; through cool forests whose shade beckoned
    enticingly; past wells of crystal-clear water where thirst cried to be
    quenched. But they stopped not at all until, as the sun sank slowly
    down into the west, they passed between the great parched corn-fields
    of Mani and at last reached the palace of the <i lang="myn">batab</i>.</p>

  <p>So quickly had the <i lang="myn">holpopes</i> returned that the <i lang="myn">batab</i> said of them,
    “They are birds, not men.”</p>

  <p>And the <i lang="myn">nacon</i> answered: “If they are birds, then are they eagles,
    for these three <i lang="myn">holpopes</i> in the battle with the Uitzes killed three
    warriors and took three prisoners.”</p>

  <p>The <i lang="myn">batab</i> cast an approving glance at the deep-chested, thin-flanked
    young <i lang="myn">holpopes</i> and said:</p>

  <p>“Let it be proclaimed from the temple that for their services in time
    of peace and for their brave acts in battle these three brothers shall
    henceforth be of the eagles and shall bear the regalia and wear the
    mask of the eagle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> in the sacred rites.” And so it was from that time
    on. The three brothers, known as the Three Eagles, wore the feathers
    and mask of the eagle in the sacred festivals and until after the
    coming of the later white men the figures of the Three Eagles were to
    be seen carved upon the walls of a temple in Mani.</p>

  <p>Great was the enthusiasm and greater the joy at the message sent by the
    Batab of Zotuta to the Batab of Mani and the tale of the warm welcome
    given to the <i lang="myn">holpopes</i> and the warmer one promised to the pilgrims.</p>

  <p>Ah! could they but have seen the venomous look and the twisted smile
    that was hidden behind the unctuous softness of those pleasant-sounding
    words!</p>

  <p>In the province of the Cocomes great preparation was made for the
    expected guests. At frequent intervals along their destined path
    from one village to another were placed arches made of saplings tied
    together and bent to the ground. Those at the entrance of each village
    were adorned with fresh vines and bright flowers until the curve of
    the arch was a solid mass of green leaves and fragrant blossoms. There
    were scarlet clusters of <i lang="myn">cutz-pol</i>, or turkey-head, white <i lang="myn">sac-nute</i>
    blooms, the frail blue jungle morning-glory, and the golden trumpets of
    the <i lang="myn">xkan-tol</i> flower.</p>

  <p>As the pilgrims reached each new village the head men and the most
    beautiful maids of the district came to meet and welcome them, the
    head men with the symbols of their authority and the maidens with
    gourds of cool <i lang="myn">sacca</i> to quench the thirst of the travelers. And with
    songs of welcome they invited the tired but happy pilgrims to rest and
    then to feast in the village. As they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span> neared Zotuta, where dwelt the
    <i lang="myn">batab</i>, he and his councilors came forth to welcome them. The whole
    city, even to its most distant outskirts, was seething with the hum of
    preparation. Wild turkeys, wild pigs, green corn, big tubers, white,
    flaky, and succulent—all were being cooked underground with heated
    stones and surrounded with fragrant herbs after the manner and custom
    handed down from ancient times.</p>

  <p>On came the pilgrims, heralded by groups of children and women singing
    and chanting words of welcome. At the feet of the pilgrims were strewn
    clusters of flowers and along the way were bowls of incense, so that
    the fragrant smoke pleased their nostrils. First came the priests and
    the nobles. Then came the lovely maidens chosen to be the messengers
    to the great god at the bottom of the Sacred Well, and these girl
    brides of the god were carried upon litters richly adorned and smoothly
    transported by trained bands of bearers. After them came the devotees,
    their arms filled with rich offerings. And last came captive warriors,
    men of fighting renown, esteemed for their valor to be worthy of
    sacrifice to the Rain God.</p>

  <p>Thus with solemn joy and chanted welcome the pilgrims entered Zotuta,
    not only as pilgrims on a sacred mission but as an embassy bearing
    offerings of peace and good-will between brothers long estranged but
    now reconciled and reunited by the god to whom they would soon offer
    prayer and joint sacrifice at the Sacred Well.</p>

  <p>Soon came the feasting, the religious games, and at last the solemn
    ritual of the Sacred Dance. The hours passed too pleasantly and sweetly
    to be heeded, until drooping lids could no longer stay open and the
    pilgrims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span> were conducted to the group of houses that had been set aside
    for their use.</p>

  <p>In the cool darkness that precedes the first gleam of dawn, that
    time when the whole world sleeps, the Cocomes in the houses beyond
    the palm-thatched dwellings where the pilgrims lay and the pilgrims
    themselves—all were buried deep and sound in slumber. Then silent,
    shadowy forms swiftly surrounded the quiet houses where the pilgrims
    rested in fancied security.</p>

  <p>Red tongues of flame, smokeless because of the dry materials upon which
    they fed, shot up from each house corner and like snakes crawled along
    the thatched roofs. Before the sleepers could arouse to their danger
    the big structures were roaring and crackling, each a huge funeral pyre.</p>

  <p>Shrill shrieks of women, hoarse cries of men, choking, gasping moans,
    frenzied prayers, imprecations, and inarticulate sounds filled the
    morning air and the barred doors and burning roof-poles were shaken
    furiously.</p>

  <p>The voice of Nachi Cocom of the crafty eyes and the thin-lipped cruel
    smile was heard above the crackling of the flames and the shrieks of
    the dying pilgrims. His black eyes glittered venomously, like the eyes
    of a deadly serpent when it strikes home its fangs, but his voice was
    smooth and oily as he said:</p>

  <p>“<i lang="myn">Ehen!</i> pilgrims, brothers, brothers of a common mother! How fares
    it? It would seem to me, standing here and looking on, that you have
    changed your minds and that you are making sacrifice to Yum Kax, god
    of fire, and not to Yum Chac, god of rain! But what does it matter,
    brothers of a common mother? Both are gods and both are worshiped by
    brothers that spring from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span> common mother. You are now saved the
    trouble of visiting the Sacred Well.”</p>

  <p>As he said these words, as if by a common signal, the blazing roofs
    sank slowly in, the cries of agony ceased, and shortly all was still.</p>

  <p>Once again the <i lang="myn">batab</i> spoke and the twisted smile was on his lips as
    he said:</p>

  <p>“Rest now in peace, brothers. This is the warm welcome that I promised
    you. Long years ago, I promised you such a welcome, but you had
    forgotten. And Nachi Cocom never forgets.”</p>

  <p>The <i lang="myn">batab</i> turned and strode from the place, the baleful glitter still
    in his eyes, but the populace—people of Zotuta and those from distant
    villages, drawn by the pilgrimage and the feasting—fled from the
    city, and many rushed into the jungles and were never seen again. Only
    the soldiers of the <i lang="myn">batab</i>, with callous obedience to their orders,
    remained to watch over the smoldering funeral pyres.</p>

  <p>It is said that the Rain God, incensed at this act, deserted the Sacred
    Well with all his court and, leaving the land and the people to their
    fate, made his home in a far distant and unknown region. The people,
    abandoned by their god, ended by fighting with one another like rabid
    animals. The shrine on the brink of the Sacred Well was no longer
    carefully tended, and it fell gradually into ruins, piece by piece.
    The beautiful carved cornices and roof-stones were wedged apart by
    the growing roots of trees and toppled into the still, dark waters
    below. When, in after years, the white men came again they found a few
    miserable Mayas living in carelessly made huts under the shadow of
    the great ruined city, and these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span> natives shunned the Sacred Well and
    believed it to be haunted.</p>

  <p>Thus passed the power and majesty of mighty chieftains and thus died
    the Maya nations.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
      <span class="small">THIRTY YEARS OF DIGGING</span></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">RIGHT here in America, only a short journey from the United States and
    closer to them than our Panama Canal, are the remains of at least sixty
    ancient ruined cities—marvelous places about which we know almost
    nothing, nor of the people who built them.</p>

  <p>We know infinitely more of the ancient Egyptians—of their buildings,
    their customs, their beliefs, their history, and their writings.
    Virtually every hieroglyphed surface left by them which has been
    uncovered has been pored over by many archæologists and its meaning
    deciphered beyond question.</p>

  <p>For a hundred years antiquarians from every civilized land have spent
    their lives in studying the ancient empire of the Nile. Millions of
    dollars have been expended in scientific, minutely careful exploration.
    No slightest clue to further knowledge has been ignored, and tons of
    books, written in every language, have been printed, so that the man on
    the street anywhere may go to his nearest library and, if he will, read
    all there is to know on the subject.</p>

  <p>And here at our very door, on our own continent, are the remains of
    an early culture not one whit less interesting than the Valley of the
    Kings. Possibly it is not so old, but on the other hand it is more
    steeped in mystery because of our profound ignorance. We know next
    to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span> nothing about it: who were its builders; where they came from;
    their history, creeds, or customs. We can read but a few scraps of
    the writings of which they left such an abundance—enough, in all
    probability, to fill in many of the empty spaces in our knowledge if
    we but had the power to decipher them and extract their meaning. Even
    our hard-won and sadly limited information concerning this culture has
    never been given to the general public. To get it one must read Spanish
    and French and German, as well as English, and the average public
    library contains possibly three or four books on the subject.</p>

  <p>Until last year no well-planned, completely equipped exploration backed
    by ample finances had ever been undertaken. Archæologists have delved
    in many of the ancient Maya cities—puny expeditions pressed for time
    and cash. The work backed by the Peabody Museum has been the most
    consistent, but even that has suffered often from lack of finances, and
    much of Don Eduardo’s work has been done at his own expense.</p>

  <p>Happily, I think the American public and American antiquarians are
    waking up to the neglected opportunity. The expedition sent out by
    the Carnegie Foundation is most promising. It has well-laid plans;
    it is under the leadership of Sylvanus G. Morley, a thorough-going
    archæologist and one of the foremost in knowledge of the ancient Maya
    culture. He has made the study of the subject his life-work and has
    achieved fame through his finds in the Maya area. He has uncovered
    many important date-stones and is the most eminent authority in this
    specialized activity.</p>

  <p>The new exploration is being carried on at Chi-chen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> Itza on a big
    scale and most methodically; and, best of all, it is prepared to
    continue twenty years if necessary, to the ultimate completion of its
    work. Fallen temples will be rebuilt, stone by stone. Every scrap of
    knowledge that can be extracted from the excavations and study of what
    is already uncovered will be noted and correlated. There can be no
    question that this work will add very largely to antiquarian lore.</p>

  <p>I await with eagerness the delving into what Don Eduardo calls “old
    Chi-chen Itza,” the completely ruined and tree-covered part of the
    ancient city, which lies to the south of the newer and less damaged
    buildings, for it is there that the most ancient architecture and the
    noblest carvings are to be found and, with them, other remains of the
    highest Maya culture—the relics of that earlier golden age which had
    already fallen to decay before the Nahuatl dominance resulted in the
    buildings of a lower order in the newer city.</p>

  <p>The Spanish conquerors discovered many of the ancient cities and wrote
    about them in their annals; and the world promptly forgot about them
    for two hundred years. Then vague stories about them began to drift
    back to civilization, carried by adventurous wanderers who had seen or
    heard of them. At the end of two hundred years we knew considerably
    less about early Mayan culture than was known by Landa and Cogolludo
    and the other Spanish padres who followed in the wake of the conquering
    Spanish flag. It remained for Stephens to lead the way once again
    and show us the wonder and mystery of the old cities. The great Von
    Humboldt came and was deeply impressed. Le Plongeon labored like ten
    men for years and tragically broke under the strain, leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span> little to
    advance the world’s knowledge from the much that he discovered. Then
    came Maler and knowledge of a hidden city—knowledge lost to the world
    when he died.</p>

  <p>To Don Eduardo must be given credit for bringing to light in the past
    thirty years the things which gave a real forward impetus to this
    particular phase of American archæology. Many of his finds, consigned
    to the Peabody Museum, are not yet accessible to the general public,
    having been held in reserve by that institution, doubtless for sound
    reasons which are unknown to me. For thirty years Don Eduardo has
    followed unswervingly the ambitious, adventurous dream of his boyhood.
    Literally, he has followed the rainbow to its end and unearthed the pot
    of gold. His dream was to make the Sacred Well yield up its treasures.
    That he has done and more.</p>

  <p>Edward Thompson—or Don Eduardo, as I have called him through these
    pages, because that is the name by which I have known him so long and
    well—is no richer in a material sense than if he had never raised
    the fabulous treasure from the great Sacred Well of Chi-chen Itza.
    But he has had what money cannot buy: a life of notable achievement;
    a cherished dream realized to the full; a thousand gorgeous memories,
    each packed with such adventure and thrill as we less favored folk have
    never experienced.</p>

  <p>He has made the well of sacrifice yield its secrets. The skeletons of
    the girl brides of the Rain God; the bones of sacrificed warriors;
    the copal incense and the religious vessels; the jade ornaments and
    objects of gold; the <i lang="myn">hul-ches</i>; the sacrificial knives—each is a link
    in the chain of evidence which makes fact out of legend. His finds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
    prove the existence of the ancient belief in the Rain God and the fact
    that sacrifices were made to him. They prove that this great water-pit
    actually was the Sacred Well. They make plausible the legend that
    Chi-chen Itza was the Sacred City, the center of the cult of Kukul Can.</p>

  <p>The finding of the date-stone, by Don Eduardo, may, to the casual
    reader, seem insignificant, but from the scientific point of view it
    is tremendously important, for it gives us one more indisputable fact.
    From it we know that the city existed in the seventh century, A.
    D. We do not know how much older than that it is actually or how
    long it flourished thereafter. There remains the incontrovertible
    date from which we may, in time, proceed forward or back to a further
    knowledge.</p>

  <p>His discovery and excavation of the Tomb of the High Priest is a
    brilliant achievement. It lays bare more facts and opens up new avenues
    for speculation. Time alone can prove whether it is, as Don Eduardo so
    sincerely believes, the tomb of the hero-god, the great leader, Kukul
    Can, around whom all Mayan theology revolves.</p>

  <p>And now Don Eduardo is no longer in his first youth. He is still far
    from decrepit, but the time has come when it is fitting for him to
    step aside from the active and strenuous work of exploration and he
    has leased all his holdings, including the Casa Real, to the Carnegie
    expedition. I know that he takes a profound pleasure in the feeling
    that this expedition is going to finish thoroughly and completely what
    he has so ably started and carried on under handicaps that will not
    beset the newer work.</p>

  <p>To the layman Don Eduardo’s achievements may seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span> small as against
    thirty years of ceaseless endeavor, but do not forget the days and
    weeks and months of profitless effort that must be spent in this sort
    of work. It does not move forward like the building of a railroad, the
    manufacture of goods, or the planting and reaping of fields.</p>

  <p>Thirty years are well spent if their labor helps in the least to shed
    even a feeble ray on the nearly obliterated pages of the past. And each
    rising sun brings fresh the hope that to-day will be the day of a great
    discovery, the finding of a key that will unlock the door to knowledge
    concerning a wonderful people whose monuments are to us as a few torn
    pages of some master manuscript without beginning or end, but still of
    such absorbing interest that one cannot rest until the missing pages
    are found.</p>

  <p>As antiquarian thirst grows—as it surely must, for few things in
    the world contain a deeper human interest than antiquity—attention
    will certainly turn more and more to the still unsolved mystery of
    ancient American and, particularly, Mayan culture. Instead of one great
    scientific exploration there will be scores. Each of the ruined cities
    is worthy of research. There are magnificent temples to be restored;
    priceless finds to be bared; and that vexing riddle to be completely
    solved—the clear reading of the Maya glyphs.</p>

  <p>And with all of this must come inevitably the tourist to a new
    and delightful land, and through him will grow a new and keener
    appreciation of America.</p>

  <p class="hang">One hundred sixty beautifully carved large jade beads and pendants of
    large size, virtually perfect.</p>

  <p class="hang">Seventy carved jade ear-ornaments, nose- and labret ornaments, from two
    inches in diameter down to one half inch, all finely cut and polished.</p>

  <p class="hang">Fourteen jade globes, one and a half inches in diameter, all very
    finely polished and several finely carved with well-executed figures
    and other designs.</p>

  <p class="hang">One small but very finely worked and polished jade figurine, four
    inches wide and four inches high. It represents a seated figure of
    the Palenquin type with elaborate head-dress. It is perfect and is
    one of the finest, if not the finest figure found in the Maya area.</p>

  <p class="hang">Many hundreds of small jade beads of all sizes and shapes, all
    polished; many of them artistically carved and shaped.</p>

  <p class="hang">One flint-bladed sacrificial knife with the handle formed of golden
    entwined serpents. It is the only perfect one taken from the Sacred
    Well and probably the only authentic and perfect knife of this kind
    in any museum on the American continents. At least it is the only one
    in the Peabody Museum.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

  <p class="hang">Several parts of other knives, such as handles, flint blades, etc.</p>

  <p class="hang">Many beautiful flint spear-heads worth many times their weight in gold,
    worked down to the thickness of a steel spear-head with edges as
    sharp as a razor, the finest ever found anywhere in the world.</p>

  <p class="hang">A thousand other articles of great value to archæology.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
